    The description of each cause is written by our members, so 80,000 Hours does
    not guarantee its accuracy. It should also not be taken as a recommendation.
    For donations to fight global poverty, we recommend checking the latest
    recommendations of the charity evaluators #{link_to 'Givewell', 'http://www.givewell.org/'} and #{link_to 'Giving What We Can', 'http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/'}.
    
    For donations to charities concerned with animal welfare see our research at the #{link_to "Effective Animal Activism", "http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/"} website.
    
    For
    donations to other causes, like existential risk and political
    campaigning, little published research exists, and we recommend doing your own
    research. For a few ideas, see #{link_to 'here', 'http://80000hours.org/blog/6-the-best-causes-updated'}
