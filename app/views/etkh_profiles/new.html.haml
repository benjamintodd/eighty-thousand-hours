            By creating a public profile, you can help inspire new people to join 80k.
            Seeing example members is a really effective way to persuade others to join.
            You can also make yourself known to our community, which might lead to
            connections with other effective altruists.

          %h2 Markdown

          %p **bold text** == <strong>bold text</strong>
          %p _italic text_ == <em>italic text</em>
          %p [a link](http://80000hours.org/) == <a href="http://80000hours.org">a link</a>
