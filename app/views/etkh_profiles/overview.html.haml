                I’m a social worker, currently a mental health clinician in a jail. Although I realize social work was not the most effective field I could have chosen, I’ve decided to stay within the field for the foreseeable future. I donate most of my earnings, with the Against Malaria Fund getting the majority right now.

                I write the blog <a href="http://www.givinggladly.com/">Giving Gladly</a> about effective giving. I notice that people think giving a lot must mean a very gloomy life, but that hasn’t been my experience at all.

                I support 80,000 Hours because I wish I had been thinking about effective career choice starting a lot earlier. 80,000 Hours is exactly the kind of resource I wish had been around then!
