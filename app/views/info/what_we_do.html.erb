  <p>
  We provide a warm and friendly community of like minded people who support each other in their pursuit of a high impact career.
  </p>

  <p>
  Broadly, we can divide what we do into three steps:
  </p>

  <ul class="magenta-bullets">
    <li><a href="/career-research">We <span class="bold">research</span> the question, “how can I use my time and money in order to most benefit other people?”</a>
    </li>
    <li><a href="/get-involved">We <span class="bold">publicise</span> our findings and <span class="bold">advocate</span> that people put them into practice. For instance, we ask that our members donate at least 10% of their money or time to the causes which they believe are the highest impact.</a>
    </li>
    <li><a href="/members">We build a <span class="bold">community</span> of people who share our aims. We support each other and try to help one another be more successful in their chosen high impact career.</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
