              Maximizing Impact
          %p
            Some of the paths open to you have far more impact than others.  That's why we aim to seek out the most high impact opportunities in the world, and help you take them.

              Evidence-Based
          %p
            It's difficult to know which ways to make a difference really work.  That's why we work with academics and leaders in prioritisation research, and our findings are based on in-depth research.

              Replacability
          %p
            Some common ways to make a difference, like becoming a doctor, don't make as much difference as you might first think.  That's because many doctors are replaceable.  We seek out the opportunities that have a true impact.
