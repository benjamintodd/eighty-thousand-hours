      body: After I left college I knew I wanted to make the world a better place but
        I didn't know how best to do it. [The lecture that started it all](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAnh2FApskM&feature=results_main&playnext=1&list=PLADC8E1234F2A2FB6)
        helped me think more clearly about the factors involved in career choice. The
        80,000 Hours careers adviser recommended that I study programming and computer
        science, and that's what I've been doing. While I haven't yet achieved my dreams,
        I believe that the advice provided 80,000 Hours will help me become a more effective
        altruist.

      body: 'Economics assumes that individuals will take as much as they can. 80,000
        Hours, and Giving What We Can, ask us to *give* as much as we can. The reason
        is regard for others, but it may also be efficient, not in dollars but in well-being.
        Selfishness has brought our societies to the brink of disaster. We are quite generous
        to others through the tax system, which assures us that others will do their bit
        as well. It is time to try unilateral generosity: not everyone will go all the
        way, but some people have already done so (more than twenty a year donate kidneys
        anonymously, to take one heroic example), and they send a credible signal that
        generosity can light up our lives, and that it is a more attractive inspiration
        than the extremes of self-regard.  '

      body: 'We all want fulfilment from our careers. However, it''s easy to be lazy when
        choosing careers and simply use salary as the sole guiding metric of expected
        career fulfilment.  This trap may be hard to escape from in later life - 80,000
        Hours is a great new concept to help prevent people falling into the trap early
        in their careers. '
