Here’s
one from the website of Giving What We Can:
> ‘It is not even a matter of some charities being 10 or 100 times as
> effective: even restricted to the field of health programs in developing
> countries, research shows that some are up to 10,000 times as effective as
> others.’ [1]

By reading this, most of us will have gained some motivation to give
effectively, and this will deliver years of healthy life to those in need of
charity. 

Just as we’re grateful to Giving What We Can for this help, it’s natural to
wonder what we can do to nudge others towards cost-effective philanthropy.
First, I will evaluate whether philanthropic influencing can be effective in
principle. Then, I’ll describe the classes of philanthropic influencing to get
us thinking about what philanthropic influencing means in practice.  

To discuss cost-effectiveness, we will use a point of comparison. Let’s put
ourselves into the shoes of Jane. Jane is a professional donor, someone who
earns money and donates it as cost-effectively as possible. If Jane earns a
typical American income for forty years and donates 10%, she can expect to save
44,000 years worth of healthy life [2]. 

One day, however, Jane makes a change. She cuts down her hours at her
relatively well-paid job so that she can no longer afford to donate in order to
spend more time persuading other people to donate professionally. As a
philanthropic influencer, will she save more years of life or less? 

Well, suppose at the end of one month, she has convinced one person to donate
their life’s income to charity. At first glance, this would seem like something
of a failure. However, if this person earns a similar salary to Jane, and will
donate as much as Jane would have for the same amount of time, then Jane’s
single act of persuasion has saved 44,000 years’ worth of healthy life. She has
already broken even. If she completely convinces three people about effective
philanthropy, she will have saved 132,000 years’ worth of healthy life. 

Clearly, her impact across 40 years will be tremendous. In this simple
calculation, although a professional donor can change the world a great deal, a
philanthropic influencer can change the world by many times more [3].  

Our actual situation is slightly more complicated than Jane’s. Our potential
audience will probably not donate as much, as cost-effectively, or for as long
as we will. We probably shouldn't give up donating either. After all, if we
continue to donate, we will be practicing what we preach, which will make us
more persuasive. 

In the more complete calculation, there is a large margin of error, but
philanthropic influencing promises to be cost-effective [4].  Note that for an
influencer whose income is significantly larger than their audience’s, the
break-even point is harder to reach [5].

Philanthropic influencing, then, promises to be highly effective. However, in
general, people are not interested in philanthropy. One cannot simply stand on
a soapbox by a local shopping centre and begin to preach the merit of donating!
We owe it to ourselves, to any potential donors and to their beneficiaries to
be far more deliberate than that. It is time to discuss what classes of
philanthropic influencing there are and how well they might work. I will cover
these in order:

* Organised philanthropy
* Popular philanthropy
* Political philanthropy
* Funding philanthropic influencers

# Organised philanthropy

Let’s begin with something the founder of Giving What We Can, Toby Ord said to
an audience of Oxford students last year:

> ‘I was surprised to find that, because I'd actually set up an organization to
> look at [poverty], within a couple of years, we'd got $30 million worth of
> pledges, which is more than my lifetime's earnings. And it's eminently
> possible for people in this room to help me out with this kind of thing -
> they could also produce more wealth going to help the poorest people by
> convincing others [to donate] than their entire lifetime's earnings.’ [6]

This pledged total has since risen to $44 million dollars, an impressive figure
for an organisation founded as recently as November 2009. So how does Giving
What We Can attract this money? Well, it begins with the pledging system.
Pledging is not a legal commitment, but by pledging, people make it less
attractive for themselves to stop giving. Pledging also permits everyone to
make their donations public. This is preferable to a tradition of donating
privately and anonymously because when we perceive that others give, we all
give more [7].

By generating publicity, Ord further encourages effective giving. So too does
the Giving What We Can community, by informing, supporting and encouraging each
other. As Ord says, we can all help. By making a pledge, by joining the Giving
What We Can community, by volunteering and by founding new branches, we can
potentially add many millions to this pledged total. Giving What We Can is [not
the only organised philanthropic effort](http://boldergiving.org/networks.php),
either, and one’s impact may be more or less elsewhere.

# Popular philanthropy

Although Peter Singer’s work bears some similarities to Ord’s, it mostly seems
to belong in its own class of popular philanthropy. Peter Singer’s website,
also founded in 2009, is based on his book, _The Life You Can Save_. There,
Singer has assembled $61 million of pledges. These pledges are yearly, not
lifelong. So if Singer’s pledgers renew their commitments five times on
average, they will donate a sum nearer to $300 million [8]. This adjustment
allows comparison with the Giving What We Can figure and other alternatives, as
in the chart below. 

<div class="image">
<img src="/assets/blog/influencing.png" alt="How much money?" />
<div class="caption">
<strong>How much money?</strong> A comparison of sums of money that have been pledged or
can be controlled. Lifetime income of American assumes median income and 40
years of working life [9]. Giving What We Can is a projection of the lifelong
pledges gathered from Nov 2009. The Life You Can Save is a projected of the
yearly pledges gathered from Feb 2009 [10] The Life You Can Save adjusted
assumes 5 renewals per pledger.
</div>
</div>

Singer does indeed attract a lot of money, and this is primarily because of his
role as a public intellectual. Moreover, because Singer is a public
intellectual, his influence greatly exceeds this dollar value. Each time he
writes for the _New York Times_ or speaks on the _Colbert Report_, he addresses
an audience of around a million [11]. 

The majority will not take his pledge. But one would imagine that they are
still, on balance, more likely to donate cost-effectively thanks to his
influence, an effect which is not to be underestimated. This massive audience
is the defining characteristic of popular philanthropy. 

One’s chances of successfully finding such a large audience are decidedly slim.
If one hopes to emulate Peter Singer, one will require not only a powerful
intellect and a talent for writing, but also good timing. One would have to
find a message that will resonate with today’s population, a different audience
to the one that received _Animal Liberation_ 35 years ago. 

It is difficult to know what that message will be and it is not even clear that
writing a book is the best way to reach people any more. Is it better, for
example, than a group blog like [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/) or a video
series? 

In any case, if Singer had not become a public intellectual, he could have
fallen back on a position as an academic. There, he would still have had some
influence over his students, readers of his papers and so on. The same cannot
be said for aspiring producers of online material.

# Political philanthropy

A life in politics appears promising, if only for the size of the national
budget. For example, the Australian government will give 4.8 billion dollars to
international aid in 2011-12. This sum is controlled by 226 members of
parliament. If power was distributed equally among these members, each would
control $21 million per year. 

Compared to non-aid related political decisions, this figure will have colossal
impact. To make as much of a difference as possible, one might set the
following three objectives: increase developmental aid, improve aid
effectiveness and get re-elected. If so, the political philanthropist might toe
the party line and play the Machiavellian game of politics for decades until a
key voting opportunity arose.

Political philanthropy has some serious drawbacks, though. It is not so
compatible with other approaches: being a member of Giving What We Can could
make a career in politics more difficult as no major party in recent Australian
political history has campaigned on foreign aid reform.

A political philanthropist, then, probably ought to donate anonymously. The
larger problem is that the chance of winning an election is thin. On the one
hand, independents are rarely elected. On the other hand, Australia’s two major
political parties have over 35,000 members [12], many of whom compete fiercely
for leadership positions. 

What is one’s chance of getting elected in a country of this size? If we place
this probability at between one in ten and one in a hundred, then the expected
value of a career in political philanthropy will be the lowest of the four
classes. Of course, we may always get some mileage from writing a letter to our
local member of parliament, but actually entering politics appears to be a
suboptimal choice.

# Funding philanthropic influencers

Funding philanthropic influencers is a fourth option. This means giving money
to a middle man who will convince others to donate effectively, for example,

* Advertising through mass media to encourage viewers to demand an increase in the foreign aid budget from their local members of parliament. 
* Funding Giving What We Can or advertising it.
* Funding Givewell or advertising it [13].

These warrant further exploration. I will just make the general reminder that
the greater your income, the less worthwhile it will be for you to volunteer
and the more viable it will be to fund philanthropic influencing [14].

We can now draw some tentative conclusions:

* As an adjunct, philanthropic influencing will increase the influence of almost any professional donor.
* The gold standard for influential philanthropy is pledging to an organization and giving one’s time to support it.
* On average, political philanthropy seems the least effective class of philanthropic influencing.
* Peter Singer’s impact exceeds Toby Ord’s by one or more orders of magnitude. The expected impact of an aspiring popular philanthropist deserves further investigation.
* The possibility of funding influencing philanthropy also needs exploration.

4.  Here is an example of a break even point for the marginal utility of a philanthropic influencer compared to a professional donor:
    <table class="table table-condensed table-striped table-bordered"><tr><th>Assumption</th>	<th>Comment</th></tr>
    <tr><td>You give 50%</td>	<td>As per Bill Gates’ Giving Pledge, the 50% league, Toby Ord’s own further pledge, etc. 50% would seem a realistic estimate because those considering a switch to philanthropic influencing are highly motivated. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Your ‘converts’ give 10%</td>	<td>As per the Giving What We Can pledge</td></tr>
    <tr><td>You would earn double the salary of your ‘converts’</td>	<td>Again, this is reasonable because those considering a switch to philanthropic influencing are highly motivated. </td></tr>
    <tr><td>You have the same number of years left in your working life as your audience</td>	<td>This factor can be adjusted according to age</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Your ‘converts’ give up on the pledge, on average, halfway through their working life, while you would have continued to donate for your whole life.</td>	<td>Because complete ‘conversion’ is unlikely</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Your ‘converts’ donate half as cost-effectively as you, on aggregate.</td>	<td>It would seem reasonable to expect that most ‘new converts’ would donate to Malaria International or Schistomiasis Control Initiative if suggested to do so by their philanthropic influencer. If the philanthropic influencer believes AI or animal welfare-based charities to be more valuable, then they may have more difficulty  directing their ‘converts’’ funds. </td></tr></table>
     
    Given these assumptions, to break even, you would have to gather 40 new professional donors in your lifetime. Here is the calculation:
    
    Impact of your influencing compared to your donating

        = (Number of persuaded audience members)
        × (Their salary) ⁄ (Your salary)
        × (Their % donated) ⁄ (Your % donated)
        × (Their years until retirement) ⁄ (Your years until retirement)
        × (Their adherence to the pledge) ⁄ (Your adherence to the pledge)
        × (The cost effectiveness of their donations)⁄(The cost effectiveness of your donations)
        = 40 × 0.5 × (0.1/0.5) × 1 × 0.5 × 0.5
        = 1

    That is, the impact of your influencing equals of the impact of your donating. There is a large margin of error on all of these estimates. Note also that that this calculation only includes those who have initiated giving because of you. You may have more success getting people who already donate to direct their funds more cost-effectively.

My comments will all be critical in the spirit of efficient discussion but I appreciate your analysis and your taking the time to write this.

>‘It is not even a matter of some charities being 10 or 100 times as effective: even restricted to the field of health programs in developing countries, research shows that some are up to 10,000 times as effective as others.’ [1]

This stands out to me as problematic. If one donates to a charity such as Oxfam which runs lots of programs then one's money is distributed over the programs. Even if only 1% of your money goes to the most effective health interventions then your donation is a hundredth as cost-effective as best possible health spending, not a ten thousandth as cost-effective as best possible health spending. 

>This pledged total has since risen to $44 million dollars, an impressive figure for an organisation founded as recently as November 2009.

One has to take into account the fact that those who pledged are much more likely to have donated and donated effectively than those who have not taken the pledge

>This is preferable to a tradition of donating privately and anonymously because when we perceive that others give, we all give more.

This issue is less straightforward than it may seem. Yes, there are studies showing that people are more likely to give when the people in their social circles are giving. But it's equally true that people become resentful when others do things that make them feel morally inferior and this can create a negative halo around giving in their minds. 

>These warrant further exploration. I will just make the general reminder that the greater your income, the less worthwhile it will be for you to volunteer and the more viable it will be to fund philanthropic influencing.

On the other hand the greater one's income the more access one has to people of a similar socio-economic class so the more potential for influence one has. Consider for example the Gates-Buffet Giving Pledge which you mention. I would guess that the influence that Gates and Buffet had through promoting this pledge is lower than that of their own financial contributions. But the two things contributions may be in the same ballpark...

> Given these assumptions, to break even, you would have to gather 40 new professional donors in your lifetime. Here is the calculation: 

In line with my comment immediately above, the choice between focusing on donating and focusing on influencing is a false dichotomy; one can probably do better with a hybrid approach]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>185</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Sebastian Farquhar </wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>sebfar@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/sebastian-farquhar</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-02-16 02:38:46</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[ In reply to your first point. It is true that giving to some charities gives you fairly little control over where the money actually goes. That's not a reason to give up, of course. It's just a reason to pick charities where you do have that kind of control (or charities whose best programmes are so good that they balance out the worse ones). I remember, I think, that Village Reach, for example, has some less and some more effective projects. But they also assess the project effectiveness pretty aggressively, so you can be confident that they'll try to improve on their bad performances and will reallocate money to more successful approaches.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>183</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Benjamin Todd</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>benjamin.john.todd@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/benjamin-todd</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-02-14 19:07:09</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks a lot for the interesting post Ryan. ]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>184</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>jsinick</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>jsinick@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-02-15 01:50:37</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[1.  I agree that missing out on a factor of 100x in efficacy is a shame, indeed, missing out on a factor of 2x is a shame. I wasn't so much quibbling over the precise number as much as to raise broader methodological issues. 

You mention first-world charities (sports, art, school, churches). Though the median donation has low efficacy, some portion of these expenditures will be spectacularly cost-effective (e.g. in the days before the internet, a library stimulating the intellectual development of a researcher who will go on to develop a cure for a major disease). 

I do think that one can make a strong case for the best developing world aid charities being much better than typical first-world charities. What I mean to allude to is that there's a strong "nothing is as good or as bad as it seems" quality to philanthropy due to a complicated web of indirect effects. This is partially addressed by Holden Karnofsky's blog post titled "Why We Can't Take Expected Value Estimates Literally (Even When They're Unbiased)" but deserves a fuller discussion.

I think to be a more persuasive influencer, it would be best to continue to donate a portion of one's money (even if less than originally planned). There is something awkward about convincing someone not to eat meat while chewing on a chicken leg; similarly it's odd to say "you should really give 10% or more to charities ... but I'm too busy to do that". ]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>182</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Ryan Carey</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>theonlyduffman@hotmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-02-14 06:48:56</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Jonah, thanks. For anyone looking to write more on this topic, I think these are an ideal set of avenues for further investigation, exactly what I had in mind when I wrote the piece. As you said, in the spirit of efficiency, I'll just provide a few cautionary notes, covering your points in order:

1. The program / charity distinction is sensible. However, even if the average American or Australian is donating with 1% of the maximal effectiveness, this is a shame. And there are plenty of reasons to think our effectiveness is even worse than that. Think of the number of donations that do not go to development aid at all, but rather prop up first-world sport programs, art galleries,  schools, churches, etc.
2. This is true, although even if these people were already likely to donate, were they likely to do so effectively? If not, the impact of their charity may have been very small if not for GWWC.
3. Yes, I completely agree, and a lot more needs to be written about this.
4. This is true. There is obviously a great difference between the Gates / Buffett cases, which I have not yet explored, and an ordinary Joe who volunteers for GWWC. There is some element of organisation philanthropy, e.g. the Giving Pledge. However, much of the work is done by secretaries and public relations people (funding organisational philanthropy). And there is a further element, as you suggest, of direct philanthropic influencing of wealthy friends, colleagues and acquaintances that arguable eludes my classification system.
5. But of course. The hybrid approach is the winner here. ("As an adjunct, philanthropic influencing will increase the influence of almost any professional donor"), and if only half of your work is done as a philanthropic influencer, then you only need to win over about 20 donors!]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Why doesn’t everyone use matching donations?</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/34-why-doesn-t-everyone-use-matching-donations</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[![arithmetic](http://robertwiblin.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/matching_gift_hero_0.png)

For the last two years whenever I have felt charitable, rather than directly give away the money - to [Village Reach](http://villagereach.org/) incidentally - I have offered to match donations made by my Facebook friends 1:1. Initially I could only raise a few hundred dollars in matching donations, but most recently I attracted almost $2000 with little effort. I always kept the maximum amount I was willing to match above what I expected would be forthcoming, so that matchers were apparently inducing me to donate more. Is all this a good thing to do?

The obvious answer is yes. By matching donations I am inducing others to donate more than they otherwise would. As long as I can find enough people to match that I don’t donate much less than I otherwise would, I’m increasing the additional effect of my donation. This is probably right. That said, it’s likely that many of those other folk were planning to give some money away anyway and reduced their other donations in order to match mine. For this reason I don’t believe that I was really causing two dollars to be donated for each dollar that I gave. The additional impact was probably quite a bit less.

An outside possibility is that donation matching not only doesn’t induce extra donations but rather ‘crowds them out’. This would be the effect if the people who matched my donation reduced their other donations by more than one dollar for each dollar they matched for me. Why would that happen? It could if they were targeting a certain amount of charitable donations each year and counted each dollar they matched for me as more than one dollar given, because the considered themselves partially ‘responsible’ for my donation as well. Having given $X, they feel like they have given $2X and cut back on $2X donations in the rest of their life. Thinking through human psychology I doubt this happens much, but it’s possible.

Even if it were true though, I would still use matching donations. The charity that I was donating to, Village Reach, can probably avert an infant death through vaccinations [for around $500](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/villagereach). That is far more effective than most other charitable organisations [1]. While the people matching my donations are a clever and discriminating lot, my guess is that any donations I might have ‘crowded out’ would still have gone to less effective causes. It was worth matching just to better direct the funds.

Furthermore, inducing someone to give to Village Reach once, and making them aware of how effective their interventions are, will probably tempt them to give more in future both out of habit and a [desire for consistency](http://lesswrong.com/lw/4e/cached_selves/) in their behaviour.

Further still, I was able to splash our giving all over our Facebook profiles, advertising what we were doing to my and their friends. While normally advertising one’s generosity in this way would be gauche, I have a good excuse (I am looking for matching donations!) and so do they (I did it not them, and it’s good to raise awareness!) which makes it socially acceptable. This raises the benefits of giving for us donors, probably tempting us to give more than we would otherwise.

This scheme also changes and raises the standards of what is admirable do-goodery for everyone who happens to be watching: not signing a petition or watching a YouTube clip, but rather giving hundreds or thousands of dollars to an organisation you have properly researched. Maybe this will improve their behaviour too.

The only mystery to me is why matching donations on social networking sites are not more popular. I hope I am just ahead of the rush.

[1] Though not as effective as existential risk reduction I now think. I would say the key downside of using matching donations is that it tempted me to give to familiar ‘African health program’ interventions that would attract matching donations, rather than more unusual but probably more effective [animal](http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/dollar-worth.pdf) [welfare](http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/vegan-outreach.html) or [existential](http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/resources/publications/2007/2007-10-15-reducingrisk.html) [risk](http://singinst.org/grants/AIrisksphilanthropy) [charities](http://www.global-catastrophic-risks.com/docs/Chap01.pdf).

But how do we decide? It is all very well to say that a charity that saves 100 lives is better than a charity that saves 10 lives for the same cost, but not all charities are so easily comparable. Here I will try to compare health and education interventions.

##The Competitors - And Their Weights

First let me present health, coming in with a mighty possible [$3.50 for a year of life at full health](http://wikicharities.org/index.php?title=Health_Education). The reigning champ, in that most of the charities I have seen recommended on this website support health interventions. 

Next we have education, coming in with a mighty [$2.50 for a year of schooling](http://www.povertyactionlab.org/policy-lessons/education/student-participation). To clarify, this is the absolute minimum cost that a charity could put in to let a child in a developing country attend primary schooling for another year.

So we are roughly comparing the benefit of 1 year of life at full health to 1.5 years extra primary schooling in a developing country

##Round 1: Direct Benefits to Individuals

Would you lose out on health for a year to gain the happiness brought to you by being better educated, to gain the ability to read and count? Can we put a value on such a thing? Not easily. 

Let’s consider what data is available. The [World Values Survey](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org) asked people how happy they consider themselves, how much education they had achieved and their state of health. The results showed that, taking into account the extra benefits of education such a better paid job, being educated did not tend to make people happier. Health, on the other hand, had the biggest direct impact on happiness of any factor.

These results need to be treated with caution. They may vary with factors such as the recipient’s age or nationality, and there are other plausible ways of comparing the direct benefits. Yet the survey strongly suggests that health has a much bigger direct impact on people’s happiness than education. So round 1 goes to health.

##Round 2: Indirect Benefits - Individuals Achieve More 

Educated individuals will earn more and achieve more. In developing countries, one additional year in school will [increase wages in later life by about 10%](http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Admin/Public/DWSDownload.aspx?File=%2fFiles%2fFiler%2fCC08%2fPapers%2f0+Challenge+Papers%2fCP_EducationCC08vol2.pdf). It is reasonable to suppose that people would sacrifice some degree of health to be that 10% better off, (especially where that 10% can mean food on the table). Healthier people will also earn more, but not to the same degree. At first glance education looks to be winning this round hands down.

Or so it may seem. The big problem here is that in developing countries increasing education has almost [no effect on the average wage](http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/3/367.full.pdf). This is because education is used as a way of selecting employees. The students who stay longer in education will be offered better jobs. Most less developed countries are educating enough people (to primary level) to fill all the jobs that need educated people.

What we really need to consider are the benefits of education upon society as a whole and the benefits of health interventions on society as a whole. Round 2 is declared a draw.

##Round 3: Indirect Benefits – to Society

Further increasing levels of primary education in developing countries has shown minimal or no economic benefits. A [study](http://www.cfses.com/documents/wp36.pdf) in China found that on average one year in school led to a 1% increases in income. On the other hand in times of rapid technological development, such as the Green Revolution in India, basic education had a significant effect.

Health interventions can have a significant economic impact. As can be imagined, if people are healthier and stronger they can work harder and longer. For example one [study](http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/msingha/malaria_aug09.pdf) that compared areas with different levels of malaria estimated that eradicating malaria in an area would give a 3% increase in income.

It is hard to get an accurate estimation of exactly how much the economy benefits from health or education interventions, and it could vary drastically upon the intervention. For these reasons I will declare round 3 a draw, with a personal leaning towards health interventions.

##Round 4: Health Benefits of Education Interventions and the Education Benefits of Health Interventions

Making children healthier will allow them to spend longer in school. The effect on education of a health intervention depends on the particular intervention. The very best case scenarios I have found [(deworming)](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/resources/what-you-can-achieve.php) provide one year of schooling for every one year of life at full health.

There are however huge health benefits to educating children. The most staggering one of these is that one year of extra education for women can lead to [a reduction in infant mortality rates by 5-10%](http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/DCP). This is astounding - it means that by encouraging education you could save a child’s life for about $160. Round 4 is won by education.

##Some Conclusions

Overall, health interventions look more promising. The most effective health interventions for reducing infant mortality save about 1 child for every $30, but when choosing an intervention we should consider how it impacts health and education. Further, when trying to estimate the effectiveness of a charity, it is reasonable to treat education as a health intervention, as increasing health is the biggest positive effect of increasing education. 

‘Boo!’ I hear you shout we wanted a knock out not some kind of pansy meeting of ways. It is all so vague and approximate. Just because we cannot know for sure, does not mean that we should not follow our [best guesses](http://80000hours.org/blog/4-estimation-is-the-best-we-have).

Other factors to be considered are the benefits of secondary and further education for developing countries. Also you may be losing out by not educating the possible next Einstein or Ghandi. Maybe you believe that we all have a right to basic education and that it should be supported as something that is good in and of itself.

And if some of you are wondering how reducing infant mortality compares to improving the health of adults and older children, then tune in at an unspecified future date for Reducing Infant Mortality vs Improving Health.

It stands, along William Easterly's _The Elusive Quest for Growth_ and _The White Man's Burden_, as the central work of foreign aid scepticism. 

Moyo's basic argument is that foreign aid is actually counter-productive precisely because we are so willing to give it: because leaders are virtually guaranteed to receive foreign aid, they do not attempt to use it to benefit their populations. Aid functions as a ‘moral hazard’ for recipient governments, incentivising corruption and civil war - for whoever reaches power will have access to an unending fount of foreign funding. Moyo proposes that we remove the distorting force that is foreign aid, and allow governments to find other sources of finance - most notably by opening their countries to foreign capital markets.

While _Dead Aid_ is interesting insofar as it challenges certain development clichés and received wisdom, it has several major flaws.

* Concentrating solely on government aid

One factor which makes _Dead Aid_ less relevant than it could be to an organisation like 80,000 Hours is that it concentrates solely on ‘official aid’ (from international organisations and the governments of international organisations to recipient governments); it does not take into account private international philanthropy or humanitarian relief, or the work of most NGOs. As such, it simply has nothing to contribute on what most people can do as individuals to have a significant positive impact in the world.

* Over-reliance on market-logic in development

But even concerning official aid, Moyo's book has several weaknesses. For one, its concept of development is strictly economic is a rather narrow sense: her argument is built on the basic correlation between aid and growth, and the fact that whereas aid has increased significantly over the past several decades, growth has remained stagnant. But over the same period she examines, the life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa has increased by 10 years, or 20% (from 40 to 50). Simply put, Moyo's conception of development is too centred on economic growth, not on quality of life. Given her background, working for eight years at Goldman Sachs, this should perhaps not be too surprising.

* Unquestioning, and outmoded, neoliberalism

Whatever the objective merits of the argument of _Dead Aid_, there is no question that its 2009 release was colossally ill-timed. Moyo would have us replace foreign aid as a source of finance for poorer countries with increased access to global capital markets. But the events of 2008-2009 have brought into question the wisdom of relying on such a volatile a thing as financial markets - though the lesson was there in the repeated developing world financial crises of Russia, (1998) East Asia (1997), Mexico (1994), and the repeated Latin American crises of the 1980s. 

What's more, given the current state of the sovereign debt crisis in Greece and southern Europe more generally, it is extremely unlikely that banks would even be willing to offer loans to impoverished African governments in the first place. So while Moyo does question the conventional wisdom of development, she seems incapable of questioning her deeply ingrained, and increasingly outmoded, neoliberal capitalism.

* Theoretical vs empirical economics

Finally, its findings aside, there are certain quibbles to be had with _Dead Aid_'s methodology - or, more broadly, its whole approach to economics. The book is, at its core, an extraordinarily simple, grand argument. Once she has established that economic growth has stayed constant while foreign aid has increased, Moyo jumps straight to the conclusion that all aid should be cut off. The generalisation she makes is quite unwarranted from the evidence - it is equally possible that, in the absence of foreign aid, that growth would have been significantly diminished. The only evidence she draws to the contrary is abstract neoclassical cliché about market distortions and moral hazards.

But the substance of her generalisation aside, _Dead Aid_ exemplifies a kind of economics that seeks grand, sweeping generalisations in the first place, instead of examining evidence rigorously, from the bottom up, and constructing practical solutions to specific problems. The experimental method championed by Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo in their 2011 _Poor Economics_ represents a refreshingly sober, nuanced, and pragmatic alternative to the sort of grand theorising that’s based on a single, simplified correlation.

Something I feel we all have to take into account here is humility. I must have heard a dozen people claim dead aid is sensationalised, irresponsible and poorly referenced (at least one of those was me, conversationally it sort of roles off the tongue and the book appears to have given anti-charity types a number of one-liners that drive me up the wall!) Yet the topic is not a closed matter, many of the world's best economists put their name to less-extreme versions of this idea long before whats her face came along, and I think to sweep it aside like this doesn't do our (80k) credibility justice. 

For instance, I'm 90% (call it 30) sure that dead aid's idea didn't rely on an efficient market or a neo-liberalistic assumption but that's not really the point. Many economists, myself included, hold the markets in as much awe as the human circulatory system and to hear them flippantly discredited... well it doesn't turn me on lets put it that way.
 
I guess what I'm saying is that bearing in mind we put ourselves forward as a community of extremely rational people and that we are swimming up-current against a tide of opinions that will jump at the opportunity to prove otherwise: should we be making claims and criticisms that suggest a higher level of certainty in our claims than can be rationally justified?

Besides! Dead Aid might end up being the spanner in the impulse-giving community's works that brings about a massive cultural swing towards altruistic rationality! It certainly convinced a whole load of people that the problem wasn't going to be 'solved by the government'.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>229</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Benjamin Todd</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>benjamin.john.todd@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/benjamin-todd</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-03-21 15:00:39</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[80k itself tries not to take political positions, but we do argue that aid can be very effective if done carefully.

They are more likely to give, and they give more money. So why is the smart giving/effective philanthropy/whatever-you-want-to-call-it movement so skewed male?

About a quarter of the members of [Giving What We Can](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/our-members.php) and [80,000 Hours](http://80000hours.org/members) are women. At any kind of discussion on efficient giving, I'm usually either the only woman or one of two women there. This doesn't bother me in itself, but it means we're missing people who could have a lot to give to the conversation. I don't believe women are more selfish than men or that they want to help people less than men do. So where are they?

Some of my guesses:

A lot of this movement came out of university philosophy departments. At least in the US, only [1/3](http://crookedtimber.org/2011/02/04/gender-divides-in-philosophy-and-other-disciplines/) of philosophy PhD students are female - that's more skewed than math or almost any of the sciences. Apparently not that many women want to sign up for five years of having their ideas ripped apart.

There's a good bit of finance and math involved in finding the best charities. I have very little math background, and while I think posts like [this](http://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/) are very important, I can't get through them. A lot of women also didn't do much with math or economics. Until recently, there was never anything I wanted to understand that required me to know much about math or money, and I was disheartened to realize I was going to have to learn some. 

Lately, there's also an increased emphasis in this movement on careers and choosing a career that will let you do the most good (usually through high pay). I think boys get the message early on that they should optimize for high pay because this is what will impress other men, attract mates, and support their families. As a girl, I never got the message that I needed money to do these things. The emphasis was more on personality, beauty, and accommodating other people. Unfortunately, these things are not especially helpful to me now in reducing child mortality. 

As a child I, at least, was told that my interest in helping strangers was somehow unnatural if it wasn't preceded by being extra nice to people around me. Ordinary childhood squabbles with my sister often brought on the question from my mother, “How can you care so much about strangers and so little about your family?” I think I was about as selfish in my everyday activities as other children and teenagers I knew, but to this day if I hurt someone's feelings I get the hypocrisy accusation from my mother. If I were a boy, I'm not sure if this would have happened. I think there's less pressure on boys to make nice, and it's considered more normal for them to care about the big picture more than household emotional politics. Girls get stronger approval if they focus their energy on being nice to those near them.

(To be fair, my parents also tell me they're proud of my giving. But they seem to regard writing a cheque and refraining from snarky comments as the _same skill_, and in fact I'm better at the former than the latter. Working on it, though.)

In adulthood, women are still primarily responsible for the emotional wellbeing of the household. In most families I know, the mother is more financially permissive with the children than the father is. Women understand that they will be in charge of distributing family money and time to keep everyone happy. It may be emotionally harder for them to not buy the kids all 17 of the Christmas presents they asked for, or to decide to have fewer kids in the first place, or to work long hours and serve frozen dinners. A man who chose not to have children, or to raise his children on a voluntarily low budget, probably wouldn't get the same flak a woman would. So the choice to give more may be harder for women.

Non-efficient charity (the food drive, the house of worship, the Girl Scout cookies, the solicitations from the children's hospital and the animal shelter, the cousin who needs a loan) is largely about community connections. Women are often in charge of maintaining these connections on behalf of a family. I think this is why you see higher donations from women. It's true of woman-headed households and not just women acting on behalf of a joint household, but I expect that's because we continue in the patterns we were socialized to even if our later home life doesn't match the conditions we were expecting.

My message to my female readers (there are some? Right?) is: _you can do this_. You can have a happy family life. You can be analytical and argumentative. You can learn [statistics](http://www.khanacademy.org/#statistics). You can do what you know is the right thing rather than what will make you seem most normal.

Your mother might be annoyed with you, but that's pretty much inevitable.

About the philosophy PhD students - maybe its not that women don't want to go into a philosophy PhD, maybe they are discriminated against and just not admitted into universities, or maybe they are admitted and feel so discriminated against that they tend to quit more, etc. About the math - empirical studies suggest that women are as good in math as men, and they also seem to enjoy it as much, even if many women are discouraged from pursuing these interests as a profession out of gender prejudices. About frozen dinners - you seem to assume that women are the ones who feed the family (and this may be descriptively true, for the most part), but men can also cook, and the answer is dividing household chores, not frozen dinners.

I agree with your general observations about women's emotional education and think this kind of education (about caring for others' emotional wellbeing, for example) should be extended to men.Maybe women don't participate in the organizations you are mentioning because the men in them are not facilitating women to participate. Men tend to me enamoured with their own voices and tend to (mostly inadvertedly) quiet women's voices - and it is quite likely that men philosophers are particularly prone to this bad habit. Given that women are discriminated against in almost all spheres of life - and in academia this is obviously true (e.g. women earn about 75% the amount men earn) - I think that Giving  What We Can and 80,000 should be ACTIVELY trying to include women in their ranks (this is specially true for men in these organizations).]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>In praise of Viktor Zhdanov</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/27-in-praise-of-viktor-zhdanov</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[Until 2010, [Viktor Zhdanov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Zhdanov), didn't even have a Wikipedia page. No big deal, you say, unless you realize Viktor Zhdanov was the single most important person of the last millennium. A bold claim, and one which I will attempt to substantiate. No angel, he was involved in the Soviet Union's biological warfare program, but the good he has done is incalculable. 

I've been looking into was responsible for the greatest good over the last millennium and how that achievement has been recognized. 

There can be little debate that the eradication of smallpox stands out as humanity’s greatest achievement of the last millennium. In the twentieth century alone, smallpox is estimated to have killed 300m-500m, not to mention causing a countless amount of human disfigurement. And that is just for the twentieth century, and with the effects of smallpox's eradication factored in. If smallpox had not been eradicated, the twentieth century death toll would have been far higher. Wars pale by comparison, World War II for instance, by far the largest war, is estimated at most to have resulted in 78m deaths. 

So who is responsible for this outstanding achievement? Society and the conventional literature places the credit and the numerous awards and rewards with [D.A. Henderson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.A._Henderson). This conventional analysis is wrong, or at least too simplistic. D.A. Henderson was in charge of the WHO smallpox eradication program, but he was acting as an agent. It was a job. A job that at least initially he didn't even want, but was told it was the only way he could get a promotion. Had he not taken the job someone else would have filled it, and smallpox would still have likely been eradicated. 

So who was really should take the credit for the elimination of smallpox? The credit really lies with whoever was responsible for the creation of the smallpox eradication position that D.A. Henderson filled and determined what D.A. Henderson's work should be. And that, as best as I can determine, was one man, Viktor Zhdanov. He proposed and convinced the World Health Assembly to adopt a program to eradicate smallpox. 

This might not seem like a great achievement now, but at the time it was. At the time no disease had ever been eradicated before, and people argued that doing so was therefore impossible. How could man eradicate disease? How could the bureaucratic problems of coordinating the actions of 100 or more countries in the world be overcome? 

So contentious was the issue that Viktor Zhdanov's proposal to eradicate smallpox was ultimately passed by the World Health Assembly by a mere two votes. Had Viktor Zhdanov not put forth and lobbied for his proposal, smallpox would not have been eradicated. And yet Viktor Zhdanov amounts to nothing more than a footnote in the history of the eradication of the disease. 

Whether Viktor Zhdanov was truly responsible for the eradication of smallpox isn't certain. Perhaps part of the responsibility lies with a subordinate who proposed the plan to him, or with Viktor Zhdanov's elementary school teacher for getting Viktor interested in science. It seems though that in making his proposal he was acting as a principal or free agent, and as such a large part of the responsibility for the eradication of smallpox belongs to him. 

The lesson of Viktor Zhdanov is clear: to truly make a difference it is important to act as a principal, but don't be surprised if you die unrecognized, and all of the credit accrues to those acting as your agents.

I think this post risks overstating the impact of eradication as such. There was already an efficient vaccine for smallpox (along with better sanitation) which was averting the great majority of cases. Eradication meant bringing the vaccine to pockets of the unvaccinated where smallpox still existed.Without eradication, we would still have had the vaccine, and deaths would have remained far below historical rates, striking where vaccination was locally disrupted. Look at polio, which was not eradicated (the effort is ongoing) but which has still inflicted vastly reduced harm post-vaccine.

Eradication certainly had great benefits in averting the ongoing costs of vaccination, in eliminating pockets of the disease, and in averting the risk of a future vaccine-resistant strain, but I don't think it averted hundreds of millions of deaths.

Also, the counterfactual world without Zhdanov would almost certainly have witnessed an eventual eradication effort: Zhdanov's effect was likely bringing eradication sooner (getting some extra years of the benefits thereof, perhaps).]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>211</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Joshua Fox</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>joshuatfox@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-02-27 06:42:56</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Wikipedia says "Professor Zhdanov chaired the Soviet Union's Interagency Science and Technology Council on Molecular Biology and Genetics, which directed the Soviet biological weapons program. " Although that program did not result in mass death, it makes an interesting comparison to Fritz Haber, also an innovator in live-giving and life-destroying.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Net Impact Survey: Hopeful News for Ethical Careers</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/108-net-impact-survey-hopeful-news-for-ethical-careers</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[Net Impact, a US charity, has released a report on attitudes towards ethical careers. The report contains hopeful news for the high-impact career market, but the findings must be treated with caution. The report suggests that current students are more inclined to go into ethical careers, and that they will be happier if they do. Having an impact with their job is very important to current students. **31% of students describe making an impact as essential, compared to only 15% of older generations**. This is higher than the percentage of students who say wealth (13%) or prestige (19%) are essential. 45% say they would trade 15% of their salary to make more impact.

![Net Impact](http://netimpact.org/netimpact-logo.png)

The advice for those trying to recruit to ethical careers is twofold: First, be personal. More people are motivated to “work in a company with their values” (58%) than more impersonal goals like tackling inequality (20%). Second, wealth may not be the key thing, but financial security is. Flexible work, job security, and enough money to pay off student debts are essential.

These results must be tempered with caution however. Net Impact (and the Heldrich Center for
Workforce Development at Rutgers University) conducted the survey, but their analysis is less rigorous than could be hoped. There has been little attempt to assess the statistical significance of the results. It must be noted that all these conclusions are based on self-reports, so false reporting will be significant. This report is not strong evidence on its own, but should be treated as a valuable starting point for further investigation.

Instead, it’s better to focus activities in which you have a special edge, or on _neglected_ activities - those which wouldn’t get done if it wasn’t for you.

Seeking out neglected activities is a common theme across all high impact careers. Just as seeking out a job that wouldn’t have be done otherwise is a good way to make your career high impact, so is researching a neglected field or funding a neglected intervention.

It’s no coincidence that some of the most cost-effective interventions to combat global poverty are treatments for the so-called [neglected tropical diseases](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/resources/neglected-tropical-diseases.php). These diseases went under the radar because they rarely affect westerners and tend to be non-lethal. It was precisely because of this neglect that such a huge opportunity existed – big pharma was handing out the easily administered treatments for free, they merely needed to be distributed at a cost of only 50p per year per person. Thankfully, due to the campaigning efforts of the [Gates Foundation]( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-16788971) and others, there’s now a major move to eliminate them.

Setting out wanting to make a difference, the first things that go through our mind are the most well known ways to make the world a better place, and the most well known causes to get involved in. But it’s precisely because they are well known that your impact is likely to be higher doing something else.

There are many extremely important problems to solve – improving democracy, social justice, mitigating climate change, and so on – but there’s often already thousands of talented people working on these problems. There are other problems that are also important, but which have far fewer people working on them. It’s likely that your [marginal impact](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Marginalism.html) will be much higher if you work on them rather than the areas where everyone else is working.

The line of 80,000 Hours, therefore, will always tend to be against the crowd. We saw this with our campaign to raise the profile of [professional philanthropy](http://80000hours.org/professional-philanthropy). Professional philanthropy is often higher impact than conventional ethical careers precisely because (i) lots of people want conventional ethical careers and so are prepared to accept low wages for them, and (ii) very few high earners donate a big fraction of their income. And as one might expect, taking a stand against the crowd tends to attract criticism. That extends beyond professional philanthropy. Many of our members are engaged in furthering ‘weird’ or otherwise unconventional causes. But if you want to do as much as possible for others, think about taking the road less travelled.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier></dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2012-02-28 17:59:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>219</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Brian Tomasik</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>brian.tomasik@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/brian-tomasik</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-03-04 04:04:43</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks, Ben!

In order to make the advice practical, it typically takes empirical uncertainty into account.  For example, we don’t currently know exactly to what extent the earth’s temperature will rise, if we are to continue to emit CO2 at the rate we have been emitting so far.  The temperature rise might be small, in which case the consequences would not be dire.  Or the temperature rise might be very great, in which case the consequences could be catastrophic.  To what extent we ought to mitigate our CO2 emissions depends crucially on this factual question.  But it’s of course not true that we are unable to offer any practical advice in absence of knowledge concerning this factual question. It’s just that our advice will concern what one ought to do in light of uncertainty about the facts.
 
But if practical ethics should take empirical uncertainty into account, surely it should take moral uncertainty into account as well.  In many situations, we don’t know all the moral facts.  I think it is fair to say, for example, that we don’t currently know exactly how to weigh the interests of future generations against the interests of current generations.  But this issue is just as relevant to the question of how one ought to act in response to climate change as is the issue of expected temperature rise.  If the ethics of climate change offers advice about how best to act given empirical uncertainty concerning global temperature rise, it should also offer advice about how best to act, given uncertainty concerning the value of future generations.
 
Cases such as the above aren’t rare.  Given the existence of widespread disagreement within ethics, and given the difficulty of the subject-matter, we would be overconfident if we were to claim to be 100% certain in our favoured moral view, especially when it comes to the difficult issues that ethicists often discuss.

So we need to have an account of how one ought to act under moral uncertainty.  The standard account of making decisions under uncertainty is that you ought to _maximise expected value_: look at all hypotheses in which you have some degree of belief, work out the likelihood of each hypothesis, work out how much value would be at stake if that hypothesis were true, and then trade off the probability of a hypothesis being true against how much would be at stake, if it were true.  One implication of maximizing expected value is that sometimes one should refrain from a course of action, not on the basis that it will probably be a bad thing to do, but rather because there is a reasonable chance that it will be a bad thing to do, and that, if it’s bad thing to do, then it’s really bad.  So, for example, you ought not to speed round blind corners: the reason why isn’t because it’s likely that you will run someone over if you do so.  Rather, the reason is that there’s some chance that you will – and it would be seriously bad if you did.

With this on board, let’s think about the practical implications of maximising expected value under moral uncertainty.   It seems that the implications are pretty clear in a number of cases. Here are a few.

1. One might think it more likely than not that it’s not wrong to kill animals for food.  But one shouldn’t be certain that it’s not wrong.  And, if it is wrong, then it’s seriously wrong – [in the same ballpark as murder](http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/singer02.htm). So, in killing an animal, one risks performing a major moral wrong, without any correspondingly great potential moral upside.  This would be morally reckless.  So one ought not to kill animals for food.

2. One might think it more likely than not that it’s not wrong to have an abortion, for reasons of convenience.  But one shouldn’t be certain that it’s not wrong.  And, if it is wrong, then it’s seriously wrong – [in the same ballpark as murder](http://rci.rutgers.edu/~tripmcc/phil/cmsi/csmi-abortion/marquis-whyabortionisimmoral.pdf).  So, in having an abortion for convenience, one risks performing a major moral wrong, without any correspondingly great potential moral upside.  This would be morally reckless.  So one ought not to have an abortion for reasons of convenience.

3. One might think it more likely than not that it’s not wrong to spend money on luxuries, rather than giving it to fight extreme poverty.  But one shouldn’t be certain that it’s not wrong.  And, if it is wrong, then it’s seriously wrong – in the same ballpark as [walking past a child drowning in a shallow pond](http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1972----.htm). So, in spending money on luxuries, one risks performing a major moral wrong, without any correspondingly great potential moral upside.  This would be morally reckless.  So one ought not to spend money on luxuries rather than giving that money to fight poverty.

When we maximise expected value given factual uncertainty, we've largely picked our ethical position already - subject to clarifying what we think 'value' is.

So to maximise the expected morality given various possible moral positions seems to be weighing them all on that same broadly consequentialist position. But if that position is right, then we can infer that any incompatible ethical view is wrong, so we don't need to compromise between them. And if it's wrong then a) we don't need to account for its dicta, and b) it can't give us a sensible guide to how to compromise between the other systems.

If, for the sake of simplicity, we do accept that distributing our confidence among the ethical systems philosophers offer us is the right approach, we still have a couple of dilemmas. 

Firstly, how do we decide how much weight to put in each competing system? Do we give equal weight to each proposed system? (this would allow philosophers to 'cheat', by proposing several very similar systems and presenting them as multiple alternatives - and obviously doesn't give much consideration to the possibility of some systems being more convincing than others).

Or do we weight according to expert consensus? But expert consensus among philosophers is something it's hard to swallow. Expertise in a field usually entails knowing more of the implications of certain near-universally accepted principles than a layman (and perhaps of a greater set of further facts that are relevant to them). But what principles are widely enough accepted by (moral) philosophers to grant them such expert status?

Secondly, your examples don't seem to compare like for like. The sort of ethic which says that spending money on luxuries is bad normally treats its badness as quantifiable. It might be bad for me to only give £1 to charity, but it's worse for me to only give 50p, and better though bad still by Singer's view to give only £2.

The sort of ethic which calls abortion murder typically treats its badness as absolute. No matter who it saves, killing is a total wrong, so the negative value is infinite. 

So how can you compare between them in any meaningful way, when granting *any* credence to the latter view would mean that having one abortion and giving some vast but finite sum of money to charity is still (infinitely) worse than giving no money at all but not having an abortion?

Needless to say, I think the inflexibility of the latter view is its proponents' problem...]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>The haste consideration</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/43-the-haste-consideration</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[Here’s a crucial consideration for altruists.

_The haste consideration_: resources for improving the world are vastly more valuable if you have those resources sooner.

I’ll first explain one way to see that the haste consideration is true, and then I’ll talk about one important implication of this consideration.

People who dedicate a large part of their life to strategically doing as much good as possible - i.e. effective altruists - are able to accomplish vastly more good than most people will. Unfortunately, not many people are effective altruists. 

One way to try to improve the world would be to try to convince more people to be effective altruists. If you spent all of your efforts doing this, how long do you think it would take to convince one person who is at least as effective as you are at improving the world? For most people, if they’re strategic about it, I think they could do it in less than 2 years.

Now imagine two worlds:

(1) You don’t do anything altruistic for the next 2 years and then you spend the rest of your life after that improving the world as much as you can.

(2) You spend the next 2 years influencing people to become effective altruists and convince one person who is at least as effective as you are at improving the world. (And assume that this person wouldn’t have done anything altruistic otherwise.) You do nothing altruistic after the next 2 years, but the person you convinced does at least as much good as you did in (1).

By stipulation, world (2) is improved at least as much as world (1) is because, in (2), the person you convinced does at least as much good as you did in (1). 

Many people object to this. They think, “It’s possible that world (1) could be improved more than world (2) is. For example, world (1) be better if, in that world, you convinced 10 people to be effective altruists who are at least as good as you.” This is a natural thought, but remember that we are assuming that the person you convince in (2) is “at least as good as you are at improving the world”. This implies that if you convince 10 people in world (1), then the person you convinced in world (2) will do something at least as good as that. It’s true by definition that world (2) is improved at least as much as world (1) is.

There are two lessons we can take away from this. The first lesson is that influencing people to become effective altruists is a pretty high value strategy for improving the world. For any altruistic activity you’re doing, it might be useful to ask yourself, “Do I really think this will improve the world more than influencing would?”

The second lesson is that you can do more good with time in the present than you can with time in the future. If you spend the next 2 years doing something at least as good as influencing people to become effective altruists, then these 2 years will plausibly be more valuable than all of the rest of your life. In particular, these 2 years will be more valuable than any 2-year period in the future. This is one way to see that the haste consideration is true.

One implication of the haste consideration: It’s plausible that how you spend the next few years of your life is more important than how you spend your life after that. For this reason, when choosing a career, you should pay special attention to how each career would require you to spend the next few years. For example, if a career would require you to spend the next few years studying in school and doing nothing altruistic, then this is a major cost of that career.

Suppose it takes exactly two years for you, or someone like you, to convince one other person to become an EA like yourself. After two years, you've created one EA. After another two years, you've together created two more EAs, giving a total of four. After two more years, you're up to eight. And so on, exponentially. If you start two years later, you'll grow exponentially too, but at any given time, you'll always be half what you would have been.

So, even if you go on to recruit more people in subsequent 2 year periods, the person you persuaded in the first 2 year period ALSO recruits that many people.

But you'll be just as able to influence people in years 3 and 4.  I don't see how influencing now or later is fundamentally different from other "donate now or donate later"-type debates.  Your reasoning doesn't seem to hold unless it's "influence now or never influence".]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>331</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Brian Tomasik</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>brian.tomasik@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/brian-tomasik</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-05-09 15:49:43</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[+1 for Ruairi's reply.

I think it's a strong consideration against investing money for the future, but  less so against eg studying. There are a few problems with using it to argue against other forms of deferred payoff:

a) Improving your social standing improves the proportion of rich/intelligent people whose ear you'll be able to bend. For eg when Warren Buffett said 'tax us more' in the NYT it was headline news. When the average low-wage socialist says 'tax us more', they're one of a very large crowd who go largely ignored. 

b) The replacement effect and the need to eat - if you're talking about spending your normal working hours on persuasion then if you're not getting paid for doing so, you'll pretty quickly starve - or you'll need to work *other* hours, so you'll simply have inverted your daily pattern. But if your job is to be paid to persuade people of effective altruism, then chances are someone else would be doing it if you weren't. Granted, when EAs are displacing each other the replacement effect is much diminished since you'll only be displacing them into some other form of effective altruism, so if you happen to be better than them at persuasion it's a strong argument that you should take the job. But by definition most EAs will not be among the most persuasive of EAs, so in fact most EAs should prefer that this job went to someone else.

c) So assuming you're not one of the most persuasive of EAs, you'll need to find other work. During this work-time you could be trying to persuade people, but if it's a low-pay career then they'll be people who have less capacity to effect change, and perhaps less rationality about how to do so, assuming that there's a correlation between salary and intelligence. In any case, you could also try to persuade people to become EAs while you were studying.

d) This is still susceptible to recursive reasoning - rather than making a subsistence income and trying to persuade people yourself (especially since we're assuming here that persuasion isn't your specialty), you might do better to maximise your income now and pay for better influencers to do the job for you. Now you need to look at how much studying would improve your income (or rather your disposable income) and how effective influencing actually is - if it changed it a lot, it might well make it worth

e) all this seems to assume exponential growth of the EA sentiment given enough persuaders, but that seems ultra-optimistic. More likely we'll quickly hit diminishing returns. The current members of 80K and GWWC are approximately the most enthusiastic and (given their Oxbridge/Ivy League locations) have some of the brightest futures of anyone in England and the US. Granted there's still quite a lot of room to reach people, but basically the members we attract over the next couple of years will be the lowest hanging fruit. After that we should expect to have to put much more resources into gaining the same proportion of effective altruists, and the value of doing so relative to putting the money into AMF or whatever will diminish. Once it equals it, your argument will presumably no longer apply.

A complicated issue, anyway...]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>324</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Brian Tomasik</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>brian.tomasik@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/brian-tomasik</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-05-07 17:02:38</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This reminds me of the "paradox of the indefinitely postponed splurge": How long do you keep investing in expansion and building resources before starting to use those resources?

This only applies if you *actually* use the resources in the most valuable ways available. The argument doesn't show that if I spend $10K on buying insecticide treated nets this year, that's much better than doing the same thing in two years.

This sort of thing could happen if you're targeting your influencing efforts on, say, philosophy uni students, where each new batch of potential altruists is the same age when you first meet them.  More generally, it makes sense to persuade people to become career-long altruists early in their careers, so the influencing efforts of Persons A, B(, C, ...) should converge on people of similar ages.

And even if you can only influence people of your own age, it is not the case that the first two years are more valuable than the rest of your life put together. The B chain is only a little shorter than the A chain, and the B and C chains combined would be larger.  So I would agree in this case that there is some "haste consideration", but it is nowhere near as strong as Matt's original conclusion.

It's true that if you keep influencing, the B chain is only a little shorter than the A chain. So it's not true that the 2yr period is more valuable than the rest of your life if you keep influencing, but it is true that it's more valuable than any later 2yr period.

To get that conclusion, Matt should have assumed you can persuade 2 people in the 2yr period. The weird thing about supposing that each person persuades one other, is that then you don't get any compounding. If each person persuades 2 in the period, then the first chain is always a factor of 2 larger than the second. (and the 2nd is a factor of 2 larger than the 3rd etc.).

Then you can show that the first chain will always be larger than the sum all the others. So, then the first 2yr period is more valuable than all of the rest put together.

In realistic situations with a great deal of uncertainty, you'd certainly want to include some kind of damping factor like this. I'm not sure how rapid it would be. It seems to depend a lot on the situation.

If we suppose, however, that P2 would not have become an EA if it were not for P1, and P3 would not have become an EA if it were not for P2 becoming an EA, then it seems to be that P3 would not have become an EA if it were not for P1. 
(Apparently this pattern of reasoning, conditional transitivity, is not valid in general, although this is a matter of debate: http://analysis.oxfordjournals.org/content/70/2/286.extract)
If that's the case, then the counterfactual dependence genuinely transmits through the chain.

I think there's a danger of getting caught up in the mathematics. I'm not sure we can assign value to any period of our lives in terms of an arbitrarily long causal chain stretching into the future. But even if we can, we shouldn't take equal credit for every ethical action in the chain.

If we determine value in terms of counterfactuals there will be a damping factor that ensures that events near to your first 2-years of EA activity will be highly counterfactually dependent on your actions, but those further away will not be.

Assuming the chain leaks counterfactual dependence faster than can be accommodated by new generations of EAs, year 3 of your EA activity, in which you convert two further individuals, will in fact be more valuable than years 1 and 2, in which you convert only one.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>316</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Brian Tomasik</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>brian.tomasik@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/brian-tomasik</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-04-26 09:17:42</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Perhaps we should model the growth of EAs not as exponential but as logistic, since the maximum number of EAs can't be greater than the human population (at least until AI EAs come along). If we assume there's a maximum possible number of EAs, then the value of creating new ones earlier is just the extra area under the curve you get by shifting the logistic curve left a little bit. Once the maximum is reached, you'll just keep milking value from the existing EAs.

But this model seems to give too little credit to creating new EAs. For one thing, it's not guaranteed that the world will eventually be filled with EAs (or that the maximum will be reached, even if the maximum is far smaller than the world population). Maybe creating EAs helps to increase the probability that the world reaches a stable max level of EAs, rather than letting the EA population fall to zero.

In general, I feel confused about the right way to model the spread our influence into the future. Once we have this, Matt's question will become a lot easier.

(Yes, I know it's overly simplistic to talk about EAs and non-EAs in this binary fashion and to talk about them dying out or remaining at a max level forever. Such a model would be more appropriate for something more concrete and more fragile, like membership of a particular religion.)]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>323</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Lex</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>agdfoster@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/lex</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-05-06 05:32:00</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well I can tell you that there is a whole tonne of research on the topic of persuasion modelling within religious organisations ;) 

MATT! I cannot believe you listened to that whole discussion me and Mark had regarding appropriate discount factors in discounted projections without mentioning that it was you who *wrote* the article that sparked the conversation! haha! We must skype.

one big point I will just raise regarding 'persuasion modelling' what have you: There is no amount of time that could be reeeally be equated to 'converting' someone. Any given individual, group or community can very quickly inoculate themselves to your efforts making all future efforts to that party fruitless.

Here's a fun model concept I was playing with yesterday re giving efforts to Advocacy vs. to obtaining a Higher Salary

You have a time machine and have given $1,000 in your life time (in thousands) call it your net individual giving
you decide to give half of your efforts to advocacy , your NIG falls to $500. but 50% of your life's efforts yielded 5 EAs that coincidentally give exactly the same amount over the course of their remaining lives (above what they would have anyway) as you would have in your entire life! Net Impact = 500$+5*$1000=$5,500
five times better! 

but hang on. your $500 had to have come from a higher salary and the position that entailed that might have enabled high quality exposure to some seriously wealthy individuals. Considering the exponential distribution of wealth, twice the earnings might mean effective exposure to individuals 10x more wealthy! Lets say that Plan A guy and Plan B guy both get lucky once in their lifetime and persuade one person from their extended career network much more wealthy than them to become an EA...

Plan B: 5 equivelant people and one person 5 times as wealthy: $500 + 5 * $1000 + $5000 = $10,500 

Plan A: no equivelant people but one person 50 times as wealthy: $1,000 + $50,000 = $51,000

Now Plan A has five times the net impact! now we can discount this (haste consideration it) and perhaps the 'get lucky' events are later in life than the equivelant events so then Plan B is five times in the lead again but then we try to take into account a 'bill gates / warren buffet effect' from people un-related to Plan A guy but were shocked into an Effectively Altruistic state by the surprise of discovering someone in such an immoral industry so noble of intentions! Plan A is Five times ahead.

but then on closer inspection Plan A guy has taken his 'ends justify the means' philosophy a bit too far, he became disillusioned and was actually causing 80% the value of his net impact in grief!...

and so on and so forth.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>303</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>David Barry</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>dw.barry@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/david-barry</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-04-19 01:15:21</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree that it depends on how you fill in the details, and that with one way of filling in those details, (A) dominates.  So it is indeed quite plausible that your next two years will be more valuable than everything else you do afterwards.

But there are other ways of filling in the details, and so it's also plausible that your next two years, while very high-impact (because influencing can be very high-impact), are nevertheless not as impactful as the combined few years afterwards when you can influence more people.  

Your argument seems to be (I could be misinterpreting), "Well, that first person you influenced is at least as good as you, so they'll be making an even larger impact, and that's all thanks to the influencing work you did in years 1 and 2."  But that can apply just as much to the people you influence later as well, who'll themselves be doing great work (by assumption, at least as much as you), and that'll be thanks to the work you did in years 3 and 4, or 5 and 6.

So yes: plausibly the next two years are really important, but plausibly so are later years.  So I don't see how it's true that "resources for improving the world are vastly more valuable if you have those resources sooner."]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>304</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Brian Tomasik</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>brian.tomasik@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/brian-tomasik</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-04-21 08:24:41</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks, Matt. This is a thought-provoking post and an important topic.

First, I'll say that I think it may actually be fairly difficult to change someone else's life course, especially to persuade someone who counterfactually would have done little to help others to go on and become more effective than you are. What's probably more likely is that you'll shift the course of someone who is already an altruist toward more effective charities and strategies. If you do this for enough people, maybe it adds up to being equivalent to creating a new effective altruist from scratch.

I -- and probably others -- have an intuitive revulsion to your argument at face value, because it feels like a pyramid scheme. These arguments about going meta can be tricky. You can do good, but maybe it would be better to convince others to do good, as you say. However, maybe it would be better to convince others to convince others to do good. (That seems to be the purpose of your writing this post.) How about convincing others to write articles to convince others to convince others to do good?

Still, even if going meta isn't always the best thing to do, I think that empirically it can be a pretty good choice given the current state of things. There is lots of opportunity to expand the reach of ideas that we care about (effective altruism, or things like animal welfare in my case). If all but one person in the world were an effective altruist, then it would no longer pay off to do convincing. But we're very far from that, and given how things look now, it does seem that convincing others can have huge payoff.

I'll add one final point that applies to all of these donate-vs-invest decisions. A very strong reason to wait to donate (or, correspondingly, wait to convince others) is if you think you might become significantly wiser in the intervening years. If you find a cause that's 1000 times better than the one you support now, then waiting and learning more is the much better strategy. Who knows -- you might even decide that your current cause has negative value. (This can easily be the case when we get into uncertain waters like existential risk.) Of course, you could argue that if you inspire someone else to research these questions more effectively than you would do, then that's even better. But at some point, the superiority of going meta has to stop...]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>314</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Hugo Shelley</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>hugo.shelley@magictricks.co.uk</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/hugo-shelley</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-04-25 10:58:14</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Like you, I think that counterfactual dependence is transitive (although the article you mentioned is interesting!) All I need is a) for there to be degrees of dependence, and b) for 'value' or 'credit' to be assigned accordingly.

The chain you describe is fairly short, but as it becomes longer, the world in which one of the members would have become an EA regardless of your actions becomes closer and closer to the actual one (even if it is not the closest world).

You're right, it's getting a bit abstract! Maybe it's better to put this way - I don't think that the night you conceive a child borrows much value from their actions when they grow up. It certainly borrows less, if any, from the actions of your grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

In some technical sense it's all counterfactually dependent and causally related, but that seems quite a departure from what we mean when we say 'that was the most valuable/important time in my life'.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>380</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Toby Ord</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>toby@amirrorclear.net</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/toby-ord</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-06-21 21:05:37</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Good post Matt. I agree with others that we may be getting a bit too caught up in the exact way of modelling the situation, but it *would* be good to resolve that. Here are a few more points:

1) The consideration that at the start of a movement, movement building could easily be the most important thing to work on is pretty solid and uncontroversial. People often say: but your doing X alone won't change much, you need to try to get thousands of people to start doing it. Or consider whether the founders of Google should have spent all their time coding or instead spent some of it hiring people to code, then also hiring people to do human resources (i.e. hiring to hire). 

Sure it is slightly recursive, but there is nothing paradoxical about the basic structure, and on examination it is clearly not a pyramid scheme. Pyramid schemes are attempts to get benefits from people in the levels below you, who get benefits from those in the levels below them, which fails for many of the people because the population is finite. This is not what is happening here, as there is actually no private benefit passing at all, just a group of people working together.

2) The argument is about growing an organisation or movement in a lasting way. I agree with Ruairi that If one merely tried to get people involved to get people involved etc, you wouldn't get much overall sustained growth (even if there was a promised future point at which they start doing first order work). It would be much more effective at convincing people to join if a large part of the organisation's time was spent on first order work (maybe half?). This is true for 80,000 Hours and would have been true for other organisations such as Google or various movements.

3) I think the *haste* part of the argument (as opposed to the growth in general part) is sensitive to questions about how the rate of getting people to join drops off (e.g. is there an ultimate S-curve and what is the probability distribution of whether we reach that point). e.g. for simplicity, if there are only 4 people interested, then one might be able to convince them all early on, or later. It is also dependent on how effective the volunteering or giving opportunities are at different times and on different margins (i.e. if certain number of hours or dollars have been put in, how important is the next unit).]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1337</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Chris Hennick</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>seahen123@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/chris-hennick</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-09-23 08:38:14</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Any proof of this that applies to those of us with a very low persuasive capacity, such as almost all of us on the autism spectrum?]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Why the Myers Briggs test is not useful in picking a career</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/242-why-the-myers-briggs-test-is-not-useful-in-picking-a-career</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[While investigating how to give good careers advice, we asked ourselves whether the Myers Briggs test, the world’s most widely used personality test, might be useful. We’ve concluded that it probably isn’t.

<a href='http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/greenliving/uploads/2012/10/animals-myersbriggs-chart.jpg'><img alt="Vision" class="image large" src="http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/greenliving/uploads/2012/10/animals-myersbriggs-chart.jpg" /></a>

We wrote about why [here](http://80000hours.org/blog/60-the-myers-briggs-type-indicator-a-popular-but-flawed-way-of-understanding-your-personality). 

More recently, we came across an [excellent article on the Washington Post](http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-12-14/national/35847528_1_personality-types-myers-briggs-type-indicator-financial-success) about the test.

The article makes several important points:

1. Myers-Briggs is controlled by a family company. The franchise is worth $20 million per year.
2. It was created by one woman, Isabel Myers, who was inspired by Jungian psychotherapy, rather than empirical work.
3.It’s almost completely rejected by the academic psychology community. No major journal has published research on the indicator. This is largely due to point (2).
4. The academic community instead uses the Big 5 test.
5. The Big 5 doesn’t get promoted because it’s open source. There isn’t a company promoting it. It also doesn’t get promoted because it can tell you unpleasant things about your personality, whereas Myers Briggs is always positive.
6. The academic community are often unwilling to criticise Myers Briggs, because (i) they are paid by Myers Briggs, or (ii) they want to work with and consult people using psychology in business, and have little to gain from criticising their current main approach.

These are all things that make us very wary about using Myers Briggs. It seems much better to use the Big 5 instead, which psychologists have developed as an empirically grounded and more complete measure of personality.

When we raise these points, the most common response is “but I find the Myers Briggs useful and I have gained self-understanding from it.”

Appearing to gain self-understanding from something is weak evidence it’s telling you something significant. People claim that horoscopes give them understanding.

It’s true that if we give people a bunch of questions about their preferences, we can turn these into a Myers Briggs score, and this score will be relatively stable over time. But all that tells us is that if you ask people this set of questions, they’ll tend to give similar answers each time you ask them. What have we really learned about their underlying personality? Their score is just a shorthand for how they’ll tend to answer a bunch of these kinds of questions. That’s a little bit useful, but there’s all kinds of other schemes we could use instead (which are also free!).

A *good* categorisation of personality should enable you to make predictions about how people will behave in new circumstances. If the Myers Briggs is going to be useful in career choice, then we’ll want to know that certain types of people will do well in certain types of job. We don’t have any information of this kind with the Myers Briggs. Proponents of Myers Briggs advance lots of theories about what works with each type (e.g. ‘you should engage with feeling types by addressing their emotions’, ‘INTFs will get on best with ENFPs’), but none of this is tested.

Combined with the lack of an empirical grounding to the theory and bad incentives around it (i.e. aimed at making money rather than getting to the truth), there seems very little reason to expect these claims to hold up on further testing. (An anecdote is very weak evidence for these types of claims, where it’s very difficult to demonstrate causation).  Indeed, it’s hard to show that [even far more rigorously developed personality tests](http://80000hours.org/blog/169-how-important-is-fitting-in-at-work) tell us anything useful about which careers will suit you.

The Big 5 traits, on the other hand, have been tested against a bunch of real world outcomes. For instance, conscientious people tend to have a larger output. People with high openness tend to be more creative. Agreeable people are better at team work. [^1] The Big 5, in other words, can do everything the Myers Briggs can do, and it can also tell you new things about how people are likely to behave in the future. So, if you’re going to use a personality test, we’d recommend this one.

But the NYT recently put up an opinion piece by Nicholas D. Kristof arguing that [banking isn't (necessarily) harmful](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/opinion/kristof-is-banking-bad.html?_r=3&ref=global-home) at all:

> 'I’ve been sympathetic to the Occupy Wall Street movement, but, look, finance is not evil. Banking has contributed immensely to modern civilization. By allocating capital to more efficient uses, banking laid the groundwork for the industrial revolution and the information revolution.
>
> 'Likewise, the attacks on private equity seem over the top. Private equity firms like Bain Capital, where Romney worked, aren’t about destroying companies and picking over the carcasses. Rather, the aim is to acquire poorly managed companies, make them more efficient (sometimes by firing people but often by rejiggering the business model) and then resell them at a profit. That’s the merciless, rugged nature of capitalism.'

The basic argument applies whether or not you accept Kristof's view, and it's hardly universal. The [New Economics Foundation](http://www.neweconomics.org/sites/neweconomics.org/files/A_Bit_Rich.pdf) claims banking is deleterious:

> 'While collecting salaries of between £500,000 and £10 million, leading City bankers to destroy £7 of social value for every pound in value they generate.'

Surely we continue to need some financial services but there are reasons to think that the finance sector is overblown and characterized by a zero-sum arms race which carries the negative externalities. So Kristhof's argument refarding finance seems poorly grounded.

Since financial jobs remain highly popular, someone working in finance is replaceable, so their personal net effect is nearly zero, even if finance is negative for society (as nef claims).

The much more interesting part of the article is this:

"Liberals should also be wary of self-selecting out of certain occupations. After Vietnam and revelations of C.I.A. abuses in the 1970s, many university students avoided the military and the intelligence agencies. So slots were filled disproportionately by ideological conservatives in a way that undermined everyone’s interests. We would have been better off if more Swarthmore idealists had become generals and C.I.A. officers — and we may be better off if some idealists become bankers as well."

Suggesting that ethically minded people avoid finance jobs could almost be irresponsible. Your efforts are unlikely to prevent these jobs from existing, but they are highly likely to make sure they get filled with unscrupulous people.

And then there's all the money you could give away.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>159</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Laurie</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>laurie.walmsley@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-01-22 14:10:49</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'd highly recommend watching Inside Job for a fascinating record of the psychopathic and widely destructive behaviour that has manifested in the financial sector due to its operatives becoming obsessed with money.

In view of replaceability, the relevant consideration is how much more you'll contribute to the evilness (or goodness) of banking compared with the person who would have been hired in your place. Maybe because you were hired and the other person wasn't, you should expect yourself to be slightly better at accomplishing the goals of the banking system, but given the competition involved, that difference is tiny. However, the difference in your generosity compared with the next guy is huge -- not to mention the difference in your wisdom about where to extend that generosity (e.g., look at Romney's "charitable donations" to the Mormon Church).]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Two questions you won't want to ask yourself but should</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/154-two-questions-you-won-t-want-to-ask-yourself-but-should</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[*What are some reasons I might be wrong?*

*What would I do if it turned out I was wrong?*

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/88/original/wrong.jpg?1360874345'><img alt="Wrong" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/88/large/wrong.jpg?1360874345" /></a>

Most of us spend a lot of time visualising scenarios we’d like to happen, thinking about reasons the things we believe (or the things we want to believe) are likely to be true. We very rarely do the opposite: really thinking through worst case scenarios, or actively looking for reasons our deepest held beliefs are false. Why would we want to do this? We might found out something we don’t want to know. But this is *exactly why we should do it.*

In [this article](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/write-your-hypothetical-apostasy.html) on Overcoming Bias, Nick Bostrom writes: 

*“Let's say you have been promoting some view (on some complex or fraught topic – e.g. politics, religion; or any "cause" or "-ism") for some time.  When somebody criticizes this view, you spring to its defense.  You find that you can easily refute most objections, and this increases your confidence.  The view might originally have represented your best understanding of the topic.  Subsequently you have gained more evidence, experience, and insight; yet the original view is never seriously reconsidered.  You tell yourself that you remain objective and open-minded, but in fact your brain has stopped looking and listening for alternatives.”*

Applying this idea to career choice: suppose you’ve always assumed you’ll be a doctor. You’ve long believed that this is the best way for you to use your skills to do good in the world, and have found you can provide convincing reasons why it’s a better career path in this respect than any other options you’ve come across. A couple of people have questioned certain aspects of your reasoning, but you’ve always managed to provide convincing responses, which increases your confidence. Yet you’ve never really *seriously* reconsidered the idea that medicine is the best route for you. *You tell yourself that you remain objective and open-minded, but in fact your brain has stopped looking and listening for alternatives.*

I think this is pretty common when thinking about careers. I’m pretty sure I’ve been guilty of it myself in the past (and may even still be now!). There are a number of cognitive biases at play here which we’ve talked about before: [anchoring](http://80000hours.org/blog/141-3-ways-to-broaden-your-career-horizons), [confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias), the [sunk cost fallacy](http://80000hours.org/blog/107-good-generals-let-their-soldiers-die-in-vain). To quote from Nick’s article again (he puts it much more eloquently than I could!) here’s a debiasing technique you might try: writing a “hypothetical apostasy.”

*“Imagine, if you will, that the world's destruction is at stake and the only way to save it is for you to write a one-pager that convinces a jury that your old cherished view is mistaken or at least seriously incomplete.  The more inadequate the jury thinks your old cherished view is, the greater the chances that the world is saved.  The catch is that the jury consists of earlier stages of yourself (such as yourself such as you were one year ago).  Moreover, the jury believes that you have been bribed to write your apostasy; so any assurances of the form "trust me, I am older and know better" will be ineffective.  Your only hope of saving the world is by writing an apostasy that will make the jury recognize how flawed/partial/shallow/juvenile/crude/irresponsible/incomplete and generally inadequate your old cherished view is.”*

So imagine the world will be destroyed unless you can write a paper that convinces a jury, composed of earlier stages of yourself, not to become a doctor (or embark on whatever career path you’re inclined to prefer.) This technique may help by forcing you to focus attention on reasons *against* your belief that you likely wouldn’t otherwise have considered, rather than simply finding ways to defend against them when other people throw them your way. There’s [experimental evidence](http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Larrick-Debiasing.pdf) that in general, the method of “considering the opposite” - looking for reasons your initial judgement might be wrong - is effective at reducing the effects of an impressively broad number of biases.

Looking for arguments against something you believe strongly or have long held might be difficult, even painful. So as well as asking “Why might I be wrong about this career?” another useful technique might be to start by asking “What would I *do* if I were wrong?” Visualising scenarios in which the things we believe turn out to be false might be uncomfortable, but it can be really useful to have a backup plan - a [line of retreat.](http://lesswrong.com/lw/o4/leave_a_line_of_retreat/) You might find out the escape route isn’t as bad as you thought and actually opens up new opportunities. Continuing in the vein of quoting those more eloquent than myself, Eliezer Yudkowsky explains:

*“As Sun Tzu advises you to do with your enemies, you must do with yourself—leave yourself a line of retreat, so that you will have less trouble retreating.  The prospect of losing your job, say, may seem a lot more scary when you can't even bear to think about it, than after you have calculated exactly how long your savings will last, and checked the job market in your area, and otherwise planned out exactly what to do next.  Only then will you be ready to fairly assess the probability of keeping your job in the planned layoffs next month.  Be a true coward, and plan out your retreat in detail—visualize every step—preferably before you first come to the battlefield.
The hope is that it takes less courage to visualize an uncomfortable state of affairs as a thought experiment, than to consider how likely it is to be true.  But then after you do the former, it becomes easier to do the latter.”*

The thought of realising you're wrong and having to do something about it may be scary. But isn't the thought of never realising you're wrong, and so not being able to do anything about it, even scarier?]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier></dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2013-02-14 21:17:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status></item><item><title>New donations recommendations</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/16-new-donations-recommendations</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[Givewell and Giving What We Can have both recently updated their [charity](http://givewell.org/charities/top-charities) [recommendations](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/resources/recommended-charities.php).

The field has a reputation as high-paying, and in Silicon Valley, the heart of the global software industry, average salaries are now [reported](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2399247,00.asp) over $104,000 (£66,000) with generous bonuses. This image is bolstered by the spectacular success of tech startup founders like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, communicated by news media and movies like [The Social Network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network). Moving from salaried to startup status and back is easier than in many industries, a fact which should be of special interest to [altruists](http://80000hours.org/blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers) with [strong skills](http://80000hours.org/blog/23-entrepreneurship-a-game-of-poker-not-roulette), as discussed in the two linked 80,000 hours blog posts. The media report fierce competition for engineers between companies like Facebook and Google.

Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom there have been recent news stories with titles such as [“Computer Science graduates are the least employable in the UK”](http://thenextweb.com/uk/2010/07/02/the-least-employable-graduates-in-the-uk-computer-science-graduates/). What is the real story here? How attractive is the software industry for those who want to make money and use it to do [good](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation)? In some ways, the British statistics are misleading, but they also reflect a real difference: software engineers in the US, and especially Silicon Valley, really are better compensated. This post will lay out the supporting data, and discuss ways people outside the United States can make their way to Silicon Valley.


## Software salaries, on both sides of the Atlantic

In the United Kingdom the Office of National Statistics conducts an [Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ashe/annual-survey-of-hours-and-earnings/ashe-results-2011/ashe-statistical-bulletin-2011.html), which is a great starting point for thinking about the financial outlook for different jobs. This [article](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2067258/Best-paid-jobs-2011-Tables-official-figures-UK-salaries.html) ranks the occupational categories in the survey by median income, with selected professions produced below, including the top four. An all-inclusive “software professionals” category ranks 50th out of 422 categories, at £36,634, a little over $58,000. In contrast, Silicon Valley salaries would exceed everything on the table except airplane pilots, medical doctors (after schooling and low-paying early years), and senior executives (who do not spend their whole careers as senior executives!).

However, the BLS also breaks down the category more finely than the UK data for "software professionals" of all kinds. This reveals that areas like software development (in the BLS [table](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151133.htm)) below focused on systems software) do significantly better than computer occupations as a whole.

The regional BLS statistics [show](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151132.htm) that, for the computer (and math) category, salaries in California are 14% higher than elsewhere in the United States, reflecting the presence of the Silicon Valley software industry, at $87,990, while the [survey](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2399247,00.asp) noted above puts wages within Silicon Valley itself at  $104,192, about £66,000. These high wages partly reflect higher average ability among workers in Silicon Valley, as software companies hire the best, but also reflect the scale economies of Silicon Valley. Firms that locate in the valley benefit from ready access to a huge pool of nearby venture capitalists, potential employees, customers, suppliers and partners. These effects allow companies to produce more with the same workers, and drive up wages to attract talent from elsewhere (and for software engineers, it is often a good idea to be attracted) despite attachment to other places and cities.

##Tech unemployment rates

However, this salary information is for current workers. What about the risk that one will be unemployed? The UK article [“Computer Science graduates are the least employable in the UK”](http://thenextweb.com/uk/2010/07/02/the-least-employable-graduates-in-the-uk-computer-science-graduates/) article notes that unemployment rates for new computer science graduates 6 months after completing their degrees are 17%, the highest of any degree, although other seemingly practical majors such as business, engineering and architecture follow a few points behind. Further, this trend of somewhat higher unemployment rates goes back for some time in [Britain](http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php/content/view/1282/161/). In contrast, in the U.S. computer science has better than average [employment statistics](http://graphicsweb.wsj.com/documents/NILF1111/#term=) relative to other majors, along with its high earnings for the employed.

While this shows a real difference between the USA and UK, one should be careful to interpret the results in light of the fact that computer programming is a relatively "hard" as opposed to "soft" skill, and programmers can be judged to a significant extent through interviews involving programming questions and problems, sample code, etc. Someone who is lacking in ability, but is armed with a computer science degree (and also without much relevant coding experience, for many computer science graduates) is not the most desirable prospect. We can illustrate this by examining employment rate information by university for computer science grads, from [Unistats](http://unistats.direct.gov.uk/). 

These statistics allow us to sort universities by the UCAS points (used in university admissions, the more points the better) achieved by incoming students, as a proxy for student body ability, and read off rates of "graduate employment," meaning the rate at which students take jobs classified as requiring university education (which will be lower than the rate of employment, for computer science as well as for all other fields). At the top, Cambridge, known for its excellence in the sciences, has 100% graduate employment with an average of 580 UCAS points, with similar numbers immediately below:

On the other hand, for the schools with the weakest student bodies employment rates are comparatively grim. Importantly, computer science, information systems, and allied degrees are relatively common, as seen in HESA [data](http://www.hesa.ac.uk/content/view/1897/239/) and thus often taken by those who may lack the ability or fit for actual professional programming.

Those who have excelled in other quantitative and analytical fields, and especially those who have taken easily to programming, should not be unduly concerned about unemployment rates. In my own experience, several highly intelligent acquaintances with backgrounds in fields like physics and engineering, but almost no coding experience, have sought jobs in Silicon Valley in recent years. In general, they have been able to find jobs in Silicon Valley, with salaries approaching six figures, within 6-18 months through self-study and practice programming, or self-study combined with very junior lower-paid software positions.

##Can I get to Silicon Valley?

One might try to access top salaries by pursuing American and international companies in the United Kingdom. However, there can be large differences even within companies, reflecting local labor markets and resistance to migration. For example, the career and salary information site Glassdoor.com (which is skewed towards more junior employees) has data on Google Salaries in both [Silicon Valley](http://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Google-Mountain-View-Salaries-EI_IE9079.0,6_IL.7,20_IC1147431.htm) and the [United Kingdom](http://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Google-UK-Salaries-EI_IE9079.0,6_IL.7,9_IN2.htm). For a basic software engineer position the offer is £45,825-£47,933 in the UK, but the Valley number is $103,408 or £65,365.  For a senior software engineer with several years of experience, figures are £62,350 in the UK vs $135,709 or £85 783 in the U.S.

For Europeans seeking to work in the United States, the most common method is the [H1-B visa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa) (please note that I am not a lawyer, and this should not be taken for legal advice). Wikipedia notes that the visa allows for skilled workers with at least a bachelor's degree (or equivalent, in some cases including experience) in the field to enter the US for up to three years to work for a specific employer (although employees may switch employers), which must sponsor the application. The visa can be renewed once, for another three years, and during the total 6 year window a migrant may apply for permanent residency in the United States. The number issued is limited by a quota (with a rush to fill it as soon as applications are accepted, although in recent years the competition has not been too severe) with extra slots available for foreigners who have completed an American advanced degree, and similar E-3 visas for Australian citizens, and unlimited visas for those working for a university or research organization.

If you are interested in this possibility, and already have a computer science or related degree, this option may be open for you now. If you have programming skills, but your degree is in another area, you might be able to take advantage of the opportunity after a short Master's course in computer science (perhaps in the U.S., with quota benefits).

Interested members of 80,000 hours, please feel free to contact me to discuss your situation, as I am happy to talk and also to provide appropriate introductions in Silicon Valley.

Today Show. You can listen to the [programme here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9645000/9645137.stm).

The interview opens with Will explaining the logic behind 80,000 Hours’ “Banker vs. Aid Worker”
campaign: namely, that a professional philanthropist, or someone who enters a lucrative career with
the intention of giving much of it away, can fund the work of several aid workers, and as such can do
several times as much good.

But interviewer John Humphrys had some bones to pick. These are some of the salient points he
made.

##On that basis, we don’t need charity workers?

Interviewer John Humphrys argued that, by this logic, we should all become bankers and no one
should be a charity worker. This is a misunderstanding of 80,000 Hours aims. We’re not the Banking
Fan Club of Great Britain: we simply wish to help individuals make the biggest positive impact they
can in their careers. As it stands, pursuing a lucrative career and funding several charity workers
through it would do multiple times as good as being a charity worker yourself, but the lucrative
career is a means to an end, not an end in and of itself.

And we do assume a more-or-less constant pool of aid workers. Because as Will MacAskill pointed out,
persuasive as we may be, we’re not quite that persuasive: the NGO sector is extremely competitive,
and there is little risk that 80,000 Hours’s “Banker vs. Aid Worker” debate will suddenly create a labour
shortage in the sector.

##But there’s a flaw: I know lots of people who want lucrative careers, but not many who want to give it all away

As Will argued, that is precisely the purpose of 80,000 Hours. Lots of people have lucrative careers,
and are sitting on funds which could do a tremendous amount of good, but very few are willing to
give it to others. We are quite precisely trying to change that.

The aim of the organization is to create a community or network of people with ethical aims and
encourage them in their choice of career. We concentrate on young people, students and young
professionals, to promote the mindset of using your life to make a positive difference in the world.
Given that they are living on a lot less than they will be when they go into their careers, it will be
easier for them to give a significant portion of their income, rather undertaking the much more
difficult task of scaling down your expenses once you are already used to a high-earning income.

##But is there not the danger that as people get older, they will lose these altruistic aims?

Once again, that is the reason 80,000 Hours exists. We not only seek to promote an ethical approach
to careers, we also aim to create a vibrant community of people with similar goals and ideals, who
can mutually reinforce each other’s altruistic aims. As every one of us knows, it is hard to do the
right thing when you’re on your own. But if you are surrounded by friends who have also made a
similar commitment and are willing to go through the process of leading an ethical life together,
the prospects of keeping true to your beliefs becomes a lot easier. 80,000 Hours seeks to put you
in touch with other people pursuing similar goals, and together, as a community, we can stay
committed to doing the most good we can through our careers.

##Taking another tack: try and make current big earners altruistic

Private Eye Editor and Have I Got News For You panellist Ian Hislop aired the idea of taking a different
approach: instead of trying to convince young people to become high earning philanthropists, he
wondered if we could approach high earners and convince them to become philanthropists. Citing
examples from his BBC programme “When Bankers Were Good”, he argued that bankers today
have lost the ethical culture of their Victorian counterparts, when outsider figures such as Quaker
or Jewish bankers worried about the ethical impact of their careers and commonly engaged in
philanthropic pursuits. He contrasted this with the amoral, or immoral, banking culture of today, and
argued that we should be trying to change the bankers of today, not merely of tomorrow.

Will agreed, and pointed out that the 2008 financial crisis and much of the global recession was
in part triggered by the greed of the financiers: perhaps, by encouraging those with ethical goals
to enter into these careers, they might be able to do the job better than people largely motivated
by greed, and benefit everyone in the process. In other words, a knock-on benefit of professional
philanthropy is that by taking the job, you’ll probably be denying it to someone who would have
done no good in it at all; because of your ethical motivations, you might do the job better, and avoid
short-termism of the kind that engendered the financial crisis, for example.

##You can’t legislate people to become philanthropists, it must come from within

Humphrys then turned to high-profile philanthropists of today, such as Bill Gates, and argued that
such philanthropic tendencies cannot be imposed, but must arise naturally, from within.

Ian Hislop retorted that, while it may be true we cannot demand that all bankers be altruistic, we can
contribute to creating a culture of philanthropy, where instead of bankers telling the world “we make
a lot of money, you should be grateful”, they can live by the maxim “we make a lot of money, *we*
should be grateful.”

It is a little mysterious how John Humphrys came to this idea. 80,000 Hours is not a legislative
scheme. We are there precisely to help people develop their own ethical tendencies and then
support them in their choice. We are not trying to demand that all bankers be ethical or coerce
them into being so – we are trying to convince them to become ethical, and encourage some ethical
people to become bankers (as long, of course, as they give a significant portion of their income to the
best ethical causes).]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier></dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2011-11-22 20:45:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>135</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>sk</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>cable97@hotmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2011-12-12 17:45:19</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I am new to this concept and while it has merit one issue that I have is that it appears to be a patchwork solution. If  say you wanted to fight/donate against cliamte change and you take a job working for a Company X that burns fossil fuels and has no interest in renewable enrgy then what is the point? Working for an unethical company to fund philanthropy is at best a patchwork solution.

It is also bizzare that philanthropic organisations are not interested in the best human capital/passionate employees etc, but rather money to sustain their activities. At the same time, the possible unethical work of the contributor leads to further destruction and need for donations! 

Worrying Example: Person A works for an arms manufacturer. Person A Earns 100k. Pays 20k in taxes, government initiates illegal war (insert country here) paid for with public money. Person A doantes 30k on aid in the war torn country. See any contradictions there?

------------------------------------

Suppose we meet on the street one day and I tell you that, through no fault of my own, I’m having to live on just a pound a day for food and drink (I’d been robbed, say, or lost everything in a house fire). Would you buy me a sandwich, or invite me round for lunch? Would you give me just 50p, knowing this could greatly improve my day without really affecting your own at all? I’m pretty sure you would. I’m also pretty sure you’d feel good about it: rather than detracting from your day, this act of generosity would probably improve it.

When we’re explicitly faced with inequality, giving is surprisingly easy. It just makes sense: if you can help someone else at no or little cost to yourself, why wouldn’t you? By giving me 50p when I’m living on a pound a day, you allow me to buy that bit more food, make my meal that little bit more interesting, or have that extra cup of tea (personally, I’d probably opt for the latter.) Undoubtedly, I’ll appreciate that 50p much more than you would have.

What’s harder to appreciate is that there are opportunities to do this kind of thing all the time – we’re just not confronted with them as directly. But if you look a little further, you’ll find there are ways you can make a huge difference to someone else’s life with incredibly little effort.

Instead of giving me that 50p - hard as it may be, I can probably live without tea - you could give it to the [Schistosomiasis Control Initiative](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto) (SCI), who would use it to give someone in the developing world *a year of healthy life free from neglected tropical diseases*. If you were feeling even more generous, you could give me £5 - doubling my weekly food allowance and so significantly improving my week - or you could give that same £5 to the [Against Malaria Foundation](http://www.againstmalaria.com/) (AMF) who would use it to buy a mosquito net to protect someone against malaria. Much as I enjoy a nice cup of tea, the choice between improving my day slightly and massively improving someone else’s year (or even saving their life) is a complete no brainer.

Between the 29th of April and the 3rd of May, I and a number of other people from 80,000 Hours and Giving What We Can (as well as thousands of others around the world) will be [“living below the line”](https://www.livebelowtheline.com/uk-how-does-it-work) – actually living on only a pound a day for all food and drink. We’re doing this to raise awareness and money for these charities that make it incredibly easy for us to make a huge difference. The [Giving What We Can team](https://www.livebelowtheline.com/teams/1198?lang=en) have a tough act to follow: the team last year raised over half of the £20,363 generated for SCI by the campaign! But we’re well on our way, having already made it to second place on the [leaderboard](https://www.livebelowtheline.com/leaderboards/all/teams/UK?lang=en).

Admittedly we are doing this out of choice, but those who live below the poverty line in reality, live with a neglected tropical disease, or die from malaria, do so by force of circumstance. If you’d buy me something to eat, or give me 50p if I was doing this through no fault of my own, please instead make that donation to one of the charities we’re doing this to raise money for. Your donation will help to support people who suffer a great deal more than we will for a week living a little frugally, and not out of choice.

Good comments, thanks, although neither of these were the intention of the post. I don't think it follows from what I say in the post that you should give to panhandlers: by the reasoning outlined, any money you gave to someone begging on the street would be worth more in the hands of an efficient charity (especially if you factor in the probability that the former is scamming you) - so in any given situation the latter would be a better way to spend your money. 

You might be right that in some cases very small donations aren't worth the administrative costs. This isn't something I've looked into in depth, but it seems like in the case of a big initiative like Live Below The Line, given that much of the admin is already set up to process a large amount of donations, the additional costs of each individual donation is pretty negligible. I might be wrong here though. Regardless, I was more trying to make the point of emphasising how much good each 50p does, rather than literally suggesting people make 50p donations. It seems unlikely that most people would give as little as 50p just due to the time costs to them in going through the donation form...]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>995</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>997</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Jess Whittlestone</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>jess.whittlestone@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/jess-whittlestone</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-04-09 21:26:19</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[- to clarify, my point with the last comment is that telling someone they can do a lot of good with 50p is less likely to encourage them to donate exactly 50p than it is to encourage them to donate *at all*, where they then donate what they consider an appropriate amount (probably more than 50p)]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>996</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1034</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>alex</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>broket1988418@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-04-30 17:41:23</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Help others is a traditional virtue, can buy some toys for children, such as robot, it is more than one male to toys ]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Delayed Gratification? - Choosing When to Donate</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/10-delayed-gratification-choosing-when-to-donate</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[Most charities spend money at about the rate at which they take it in, while most foundations pay out [just five percent](http://www.hks.harvard.edu/hauser/PDF_XLS/workingpapers/workingpaper_9.pdf) of their assets each year, the legal minimum in the US. Which strategy does more good? The answer matters to you as well as to charitable organizations: you can give away your money soon after you earn it, or you can invest it in a [donor-advised fund](http://nonprofit.about.com/od/fordonors/a/advisedfunds.htm) and allow it to grow for an indefinite amount of time before giving it away. (Donor-advised funds offer tax savings and require that the money be contributed to charity.) The question of whether to give now or later is complicated, so I’ll mention just a few of the considerations involved.

What rate of return can you expect from investing your money? The S&P 500 index, a broad measure of the US stock market, returned seven percent annually from 1950 to 2009 after inflation. At this rate, an investment of $10,000 would grow to about $300,000 over 50 years. But stock-market returns will probably be lower in the future: Jeremy Siegel, the author of [Stocks for the Long Run](http://www.amazon.com/Stocks-Long-Run-Definitive-Investment/dp/0071494707/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) and the foremost enthusiast for investing in stocks, estimates that returns [will be 4.5–5.5%](http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.2469/cp.v2002.n7.4018) in the future. This lower rate of return would cut the expected value of a $10,000 investment after 50 years to $115,000—still a lot more than you started with.

Since it’s reasonable to expect investments in stocks to rise in value over the long term, why not delay your giving? Because there are benefits to giving now rather than later, though they’re hard to quantify. Firstly, it is often cheaper to stop the growth of social problems than it is to deal with their consequences. For example, it’s better to spend money on [disease monitoring](http://www.gvfi.org/) now than it would be to invest the money and use it to control a full-scale pandemic. Another example is deworming children in developing countries, which increases school attendance and so increases the children’s later economic productivity. Secondly, donating to organizations (especially those that focus on influencing people) can help them reach more people and raise even more money. 

The effectiveness of future charities could be higher or lower. Research into the cost-effectiveness of charities and interventions (such as that done by [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org/) and the [Poverty Action Lab](http://www.povertyactionlab.org/)) will continue to improve, allowing donors and charities to direct their resources to more-effective organizations and interventions. Against this consideration, health indicators in the developing world are improving (from 1990 to 2008, the child-mortality rate [declined by a quarter](http://data.worldbank.org/news/developing-countries-child-mortality-declines)). As more highly cost-effective health-care measures are provided in the developing world, the cost of further improvements in health will increase. A similar phenomenon could occur to a much greater degree for less visible issues such as farmed-animal welfare and threats to the survival of humanity. If these issues capture the public’s imagination and attract much more funding, the marginal impact of donations will decline.

There are two broad conclusions to draw from this. First, if your goal is to make the most of your charitable donations, you need to consider *when* you’re going to make money, not just *how much* you’re going to make—other things being equal, sooner is better. Secondly, if you’ve made your mind up about what organization to give to, you should probably contribute now rather than later. You can’t wait forever; in the long run we are all dead. If you wait, the problems you’re worried about could intensify and become more difficult to solve, or they could be solved without your help (a good thing, but what are you going to do with all your money?).

A final caveat: if you haven’t investigated [which charity to give to](http://80000hours.org/blog/6-the-best-causes), the social or financial rate of return is insignificant compared with the increased effectiveness you can expect your donations to have if you were to spend some time investigating the issues. The disparity between the average charity and the most effective charity is large, so it’s better to give to the right charity later than the wrong charity soon.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>

Concerns about slower economic growth don't make sense to my probably-over-theoretical model of capital markets, because if people expect lower growth, then they should have *already* accounted for that by shifting away from stocks to other investments. As a result, stock prices should have fallen, and now, at the margin, stocks should once again be on par with other investments (in risk-adjusted returns). That said, I suppose expected returns for *everything* could be lower than before.

Siegel lists declining transaction costs, declining economic risk (ha!), investors' becoming aware of equities' superior returns, and low taxes as factors that justify a higher P/E (20-25) ratio. He thinks that this higher ratio has skewed historical returns upward.

There are other reasons to believe that future equity returns will be lower. As baby-boomers in the US and the aging populations of Europe and Japan begin to cash out their retirement savings, there will be downward pressure on stock valuations. And the smaller populations of workers in those countries may mean slower economic growth.

Tyler Cowen has made the case (in The Great Stagnation, which I haven't read) that productivity growth has slowed in the developed world as we've taken advantage of most of the easy gains to be had. The economic growth of the past century may have been a one-off opportunity. Globalization has made it easier for financial crises to spread. High levels of government debt may be a long-term problem.

On the other hand, the only argument that I've encountered for stock market returns to continue at their historical level is that, well, that's what they've done historically. But I haven't looked very far, I'm not an expert, and I'm sure there are arguments I've overlooked.

One way to (possibly) juice your returns would of course be to take on more risk (small caps or emerging markets).]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>146</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Brian Tomasik</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>brian.tomasik@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/brian-tomasik</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2011-12-24 16:17:40</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[That's a good point.

What does _that_ mean?

At its most basic, effective altruism is based on two simpler concepts: effectiveness and altruism. So far so good. Altruism means wanting to help other people. It means thinking that other people’s welfare matters. 

Effectiveness is a more fiddly idea. It’s about doing something well. Say I’m in the business of making match-sticks. It’s all well and good to take a whole tree and whittle away at it until all that remains is a match-stick. You’ve done what you set out to do, but you could have done much more with your time.

That idea doesn’t just apply to making things. It applies to your friendships too. Suppose a friend comes to me looking for support. For me, it’s very tempting to try to analyse and solve their problem. But that’s often actually not a particularly helpful thing to do. Here, being a good friend means taking the time to think about what will help the most, and doing it.
An effective altruist doesn’t just do what feels most helpful. They pause a moment and think about what will work best, and then they do it. This site has [lots] (/blog/18-just-what-is-making-a-difference-counterfactuals-and-career-choice ) of [examples](/blog/3-our-worst-subjects) of the sorts of conclusions you might reach.

The important point is that an effective altruist will often reach conclusions that someone who is just an altruist might never reach. Suppose, for example, Jim is a massive programming geek. He loves writing software and wants to found a tech start-up. But he also wants to do good, because he’s an altruist. The altruistic conclusion he might reach is that helping people matters enough to him that he’ll give up his career as a programmer in order to be a (not particularly good) full-time campaigner against climate change. There are [pretty good reasons](/why-become-a-professional-philanthropist?) to think that he might actually be able to do more good with his [start-up]( /blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers), by donating much of his profits to causes he cares about.

That’s one way things could go. In that example, it seemed like Jim had to choose between doing something he loved and something he cared about. Once he thought about it, he could do both what he loves and what he cares about.

But couldn’t it go another way? Maybe for Jim, what he cares about isn’t avoiding climate change, but the campaigning itself. Or consider Lizzie. Like Jim, Lizzie really cares about climate change. She wants to be a climate scientist, but she’s realised that although she would enjoy it she’s probably not going to make too much difference as a climate scientist. She’s realised she’s just not outstanding, and it’s a very attractive field for researchers. She figures she could probably make a bigger difference working for a hedge fund and donating to fund the best climate science. But the thought of working at that sort of institution fills her with dread.

Does her calculation mean she should suck it up and go work at the hedge fund? Of course not. An effective altruist is still a person. Everybody has things they just don’t want to do. Often it’s because we think that it actually is bad in the long run. But Lizzie actually doesn’t think working for a hedge fund does that much harm. She’s actually just not comfortable with the idea - it’s not something where any sort of impact estimate could change her mind. 

Does that mean she’s not an effective altruist? Again, of course not. Life choices are an immensely complicated balance of thoughtful argument and heartfelt intuitions. An effective altruist wants to harness their heartfelt desire to do good by taking the consequences of their choices seriously. That’s all.

An effective altruist doesn’t need to calculate every outcome and pick the one that scores highest. Sometimes the calculations are just too hard. Sometimes it’s just about something you shouldn’t be calculating about. And sometimes the issue just matters enough to you that you won’t be swayed. That’s fine, but as an effective altruist you should probably be aware of the choice you’re making and understand why it matters to you.

Consider two charities. One prevents blindness in hundreds of children for the same amount that it costs to train a seeing-eye dog. If you think that, on balance, you’d rather give to the charity that does more with your money, you’re an effective altruist.

Or think about two jobs. In one, you’ll be directly helping feed hungry children by handing them grain. In the other, you’ll be organising the food delivery infrastructure for a country, enabling hundreds of people to do the job you would have done. If you’d rather make it possible for more people to get fed, you’re an effective altruist.
Effective altruism is really a very intuitive idea. It’s about doing good well.

"Does her calculation mean she should suck it up and go work at the hedge fund? Of course not."

It's always a hard line to walk regarding how hard to push in the direction of the ostensibly optimal action vs. what you would selfishly prefer to do. If you push too hard, you might burn out and scare others away from getting involved. If you don't push hard enough, you might rationalize away your own inaction. It's always a tough personal choice.

I think it's helpful to allow yourself some areas where you know you're not doing what's "optimal" so as to reduce epistemic distortions caused by cognitive dissonance. That is, if you pretend that you're always doing the best thing you can, then you'll be tempted to believe things that aren't true in order for the calculations to come out the way you want.

The programming-startup example is a nice illustration of how important good epistemology and clear thinking can be, and it shows nicely that many times being more effective doesn't have to come at a personal cost.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>518</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Sebastian Farquhar </wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>sebfar@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/sebastian-farquhar</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-08-27 15:55:34</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[May also be worth linking to my other explanation of effective altruism "http://80000hours.org/what-is-an-effective-altruist"]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>233</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Sebastian Farquhar </wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>sebfar@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/sebastian-farquhar</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-03-21 17:13:03</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA["And non-human animals."

Well, sure.

The issue of optimising action is a big one. Here's one way to think about it, not necessarily one I agree with entirely. Optimising in this sort of case is a really tough problem. It's obviously just too hard to solve analytically. That means you should pay attention to, and can't not pay attention to, your underlying heuristics. Sometimes those heuristics are going to say things like "I don't want to do this"

When you run into a reaction that goes against your first level analysis you *could* make the assumption that your analysis must be right and go with it. Sometimes, that's true. Sometimes you have a lot of faith in your analysis. Sometimes you introspect and you find out your motivations for your 'heuristic' were just selfish and unworthy. But sometimes neither of those happens. After all, you know that your analysis isn't always right.

When you run into a situation where your heuristics are screaming "I don't want to do this", and your analysis is saying "I've worked it out, and I think it's probably good." it can actually be totally rational to run with the heuristics.

You're right, though, that sometimes this sort of thinking encourages us to pretend we're optimising when we're actually being selfish. In practice, I agree with you entirely. I generally like to say "This bit is for everyone else. This part of me will act in the best way for humanity. But this part is for me, and I don't care if I'm using it selfishly." I can't really justify that, except to say that I like it.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Heuristics for a good life</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/36-heuristics-for-a-good-life</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[I wondered what careers or the like help other people the most. Tyler reposted my question, [adding](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/06/what-career-helps-other-people-the-most.html):

  *(Let’s) rule out ‘become a billionaire and give away all your money’ and ‘cure cancer’ by postulating that said person ends up at the 90th percentile of achievement in the specified field but no higher.*

Unfortunately calculating the net costs and benefits of all the things one could do with oneself is notoriously impossible. So how about some heuristics for discerning what types of jobs tend to be more socially beneficial?

Here are some considerations, please extend and criticize:

* **Low displacement**: if someone had to be hired, you only added the difference between your ability and the second best candidate’s (plus the second best candidate’s efforts to another job at random). The same goes for what you produce. Even if creating beautiful music doesn’t knock another musician out of business, people listen to your new song instead of older songs, which are not seemingly any worse.

* **Big gains to a marginal person being better**: careers that fail the above can still rate highly if this is so. This is a hard route because if candidate quality matters more there will generally be stronger selection so you will more average compared to the other candidates. Your best bet here might be in something important to you which usually attracts people with poor abilities.

* **Goal discretion**: one way a displacing person can make a relatively big difference is to have a better purpose than the person they displace in a position where that matters. This is more likely in jobs that aren’t meant to be altruistic. e.g. if you head an NGO for delivering fresh water to poor households, you only add to the cause to the extent that you are better at it than the alternative guy. If you are an academic with some choice in research topics and no imperative to be altruistic, you can add a person’s worth of effort to an important topic at the expense of an unimportant topic without having to be any better at researching. Similar for shop owners and heads of state.

* **Profits**: if you are making huge profits, it’s probably good.

* **[Positive externalities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_externality#Positive)**: same.

* **Ongoing effects**: usually a kind of positive externality. Nice cake lasts minutes whereas nice ideas last a long time (though someone else would have thought of them eventually).

* **[Negative externalities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_externality#Negative)**

* **Fueling status races or other zero sum games**: arguably things people buy to look better than other people do not cause any overall benefit, so you shouldn’t read too much into the profitability of selling such things. Similar for weapons in at least some situations. Same for selling any other negative externalizing capabilities.

* **Speeding trends**: culturesome things tend to cycle through new variants continually. Contributing a song, movie, or meme variant for a current trend certainly makes a lot of people like you (briefly). But it’s not clear what people value here: each new item while it is new, or being up to date with the current trends in general. If the former you are doing them a service by adding your bit of culture, if the latter you are just making it more expensive for them to keep up.

* **Effects on galaxy colonization chances and speed**: this [matters](http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html) so much you can ignore all the other things.

As far as #2, one area where this might show up is in the case of fundraising.

(I think this would be a useful career path for 80K Hours to write about.)

Regarding galaxy colonization, yes, all the other points basically only matter insofar as they instrumentally relate to this one. However, some of us disagree about the sign of the value of colonization. :) Filling the Virgo Supercluster with computational power has the potential to create astronomical amounts of suffering (<a href="http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?p=4454)" rel="nofollow">http://felicifia.org/viewtopic...</a>.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>239</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Pablo Stafforini</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>pablo@stafforini.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/pablo-stafforini</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-03-31 23:30:46</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree with Brian that there is uncertainty about the "sign value of colonization". This is not only because of the potential of causing astronomical amounts of suffering, but also because--as Brian himself believes--suffering might matter much more than happiness does (so even a relatively small chance of an outcome with lots of suffering might make colonization a prospect with negative expected value).

Further on this, notice that the effects of a career on the probability of colonization might not constitute a dominant consideration compared to the effects of a career on the nature of colonization conditional on colonization actually occurring.  I used to think otherwise because I thought extinction risks were unevenly distributed and concentrated in the relative short-term future, over which we have greater causal control.  By contrast--I reasoned--, if we do succeed in colonizing the galaxy, most future sentients will be temporally very removed from us and hence outside the scope of deliberate benevolent intervention by present human agents.  However, I now see that this reasoning didn't consider the possibility of a single decision-making agency (a "singleton") determining the long-term fate of Earth-originating sentience.  As Robert Wiblin <a href="http://robertwiblin.com/2012/03/24/the-case-for-working-on-an-ai-singularity-even-if-it-is-highly-improbable/" rel="nofollow">notes</a> in a recent post, "In this world it is possible to influence what happens millions or billions of years from now, by influencing the kind of singleton which takes over and spreads acoss the universe."

The uncertainty surrounding the value of colonization could also have relevant effects on moral motivation.  Even if you think colonization will be astronomically good on the whole, believing that there is a non-negligible chance that it might be astronomically bad might make it hard for you to consciously seek to alter that event's probability in either direction.  Since there is no equivalent uncertainty surrounding the value of improving the welfare of future sentient beings, this might provide another reason for working on influencing the nature rather than the probability of colonization.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>How to choose a degree for Earning to Give and Research</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/142-how-to-choose-a-degree-for-earning-to-give-and-research</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the most important early career decisions many people face is what to study at university. This is the first of a series of posts on degree choice intended for people who mean to go to university. Degree choice plays an important role in your ability to make a difference later in life. People probably don’t put enough effort into systematically thinking about degree choice. In this post I’ll look at the importance of degree choice for professional careers and academic careers. In the [next post](http://80000hours.org/blog/143-how-to-choose-a-degree-what-do-employers-want) I look at the importance for general career choice.

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/79/original/research2.jpg?1358273340'><img alt="Research2" class="image large" align="center" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/79/large/research2.jpg?1358273340" /></a> 

Our overview of the question so far suggests that, unless you hope to enter certain professional careers, you should bias your choice in favour of more mathematical/technical subjects and pick a degree you can expect to do well in. That opinion is based on an overview of recent graduate employment and employer surveys, interviews, personal experiences, and other cited sources. We’ll be updating that recommendation as we explore more of the evidence. 



There are lots of different systems of university education. In the UK, the system we have the most experience with, students pick a three or four year degree at roughly 17. In the US, students pick courses, building to a selection of majors some years later. Other countries have other systems.

Thinking through your degree carefully matters more if you’re following a UK model, where you can’t easily experiment. But regardless of the model, the tendency is to put less thought into the choice than you ought to.

There are a number of reasons for that - some are good and some aren’t. Bad reasons first. People tend to think in the short term. That means that the unpleasantness of having to do research and think carefully about degree choice is more obvious to you than the massive benefits that come later to your ability to make a difference as well as your lifestyle.

It also seems like a really complicated problem. Our natural tendency is to shy away from complicated problems and just do what feels best. That’s not necessarily a bad idea, [our instincts can be surprisingly good,](http://80000hours.org/blog/121-triumphs-of-intuition) but things sometimes get better when [you structure the problem.](/how-to-choose) Structuring the problem means generating a very broad list, breaking your reasons into steps and then eliminating options systematically before comparing your final options with a consistent framework. I’ll outline a structure for this problem in later posts. Even if thinking everything through carefully only improves things by 1%, which this decision seems like it could, it might be worth spending hundreds of hours on it because of the size of the effect.

But there is a good reason people have to avoid thinking this stuff through. Degree choice is hugely [chaotic.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory) Your choice doesn’t only affect how future employers see you. It changes who you get to know, what sort of culture you adopt, and ultimately who you become. But the way in which it does this is really unpredictable. When decisions with big impacts have chaotic consequences, it usually isn’t worth putting much effort into the decision. But while degree choice is chaotic on some levels, there are consistent and important patterns that you can use to decide. I’ll pick out and focus on those so that we can get the best possible decision with a reasonable amount of effort.

##How important is your degree as a job requirement?

Degree choice is not decisive. It’s relatively easy to move into new areas after the completion of your degree. Particularly in the UK, employers are aware of the fact that you had to make your choice without much life experience. In the US, students change majors fairly often. [“The undecided college student: An academic and career advising challenge (3rd ed)”]( http://www.abebooks.co.uk/9780398077075/Undecided-College-Student-Academic-Career-039807707X/plp) reports that 75% of US students change their majors.

 According to the [CBI/Pearson Education and Skills Survey 2012]( http://www.cbi.org.uk/media/1514978/cbi_education_and_skills_survey_2012.pdf) 80% of graduate jobs in the UK don’t require a specific degree. While it helps to pick the right degree from the start, you shouldn’t let that choice overwhelm you. Equally, if you’ve already made your choice, and regret it, it isn’t the end of the line. But there are some careers where degrees matter a lot.

In particular, degree choice is important for professional careers (like law and medicine) and academic careers. These are important for people interested in making a difference. Professional careers are often high-earning, although statistics here [can be misleading]( http://80000hours.org/blog/24-5-ways-to-be-misled-by-salary-rankings). That makes them good for earning to give. [Academic careers](http://80000hours.org/scientific-research) can lead to extremely [high impact research](http://80000hours.org/blog/5-high-impact-science).

I’ll cover the importance of subject choice for careers that are neither professional nor academic in my next post.

###Professional careers
Several careers typically require special qualifications that build on your university course. The exact way this works depends a lot on your country. Some careers have specific undergraduate courses that cater to them (e.g. medicine in the UK and Australia) whereas others are mostly dependent on post-graduate training with some undergraduate requirements (e.g. medicine in the US and Canada, architecture most places or accountancy in most US states). Some jobs require rigorous and expensive training courses (e.g. pilots in the UK) but not university qualifications. 

Careers that often depend heavily on specific courses (although not for all roles and not in all jurisdiction) include:
- Accountancy
- Air piloting
- Architecture
- Engineering
- Law
- Medicine (and related professions)

Because of the regional variation of the requirements for licensing in these professions, it isn’t helpful for me to consolidate the data here. I recommend the search phrase “what do I need to qualify as a ____ in ____”.

If you are thinking about these careers, which are (not coincidentally) quite high-earning, be aware of the local job requirements from a relatively early point in time. For example, if you want to be a doctor in the UK, it’s often worth trying to arrange some work-experience in a hospital while you’re in sixth form, to make it easier to get onto a good undergraduate medicine course.

For people who aren’t right at the very top of the talent distribution we suspect that medicine (particularly in the US) has one of the highest expected life-time earnings. It has very high median earnings and relatively low drop-out rates compared with some other high earning careers. We’ll be looking into this more in the future. Some specialisations are even better. (Incidentally, as a doctor, you [won’t be saving that many lives directly](/72-how-many-lives-does-a-doctor-save))

###Academic Careers
Unsurprisingly, if you want to be a professional physicist it’s helpful to study physics as an undergraduate. But it isn’t always important to be studying the ‘right’ option. Most top universities are fairly flexible for a number of their postgraduate degree requirements. For example, a Physics PhD at Oxford requires Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry or ‘a related subject’ and similarly their Chemistry PhDs accept students from any sciences. Often, in the UK, a taught masters course accepts students from a wide range of courses (for example, an Economics Masters course requires only “strong quantitative background”) and might lead to a PhD. So doing an undergraduate course in the ‘wrong’ subject might cost you a year or two (plus a good bit of money) but not be as problematic as you’d guess.
It’s much harder to move from an artsy undergraduate course to a mathematical or scientific graduate programme. No one will take you on a physics masters course if you haven’t learned any mathematics since high-school. So, when picking majors/degrees, if you are interested in an academic career, it can be worth biasing your choices in favour of mathematical or scientific courses in order to stay flexible.

Flexibility is valuable because the best opportunities change. Sometimes you’ll get an opportunity you wouldn’t have anticipated. It is good to be able to seize it. The world is also constantly changing, so what seems like a good subject now might be less useful in the future. Your evidence about the world is also always changing. It is valuable to be able to react to changing evidence about the best courses of action.

If you want a [research career](/research) you should look at suggestions of [high impact research topics](/promising-research-questions) while you choose your undergraduate study. Clearly, there are some years between you and your high impact research, but finding out the sorts of questions that excite you is worthwhile. If you can identify a high impact research area that you care about, doing a degree in a relevant subject is a good move.

##Do something you’ll do well in

It’s valuable to choose a degree you’ll do well in. That will give future employers or business partners confidence that they’re dealing with someone who knows how to excel. 

If you’re doing well, it makes it easier to be happy. Happiness is worthwhile in itself and is vital for your ability to be [productive, motivated, and make friends.](http://80000hours.org/blog/76-should-we-sacrifice-doing-what-we-love-to-make-a-difference-part-2) That starts all sorts of positive feedback cycles.

You also leave with a good degree class or GPA. That signals intelligence and the ability to work hard to future employers. According to the CBI/Pearson report, 46% of employers listed degree class as one of the most important criteria in deciding to hire someone making it the 4th most significant criterion. (Ahead of it were “Employability skills”, degree subject, and relevant work experience.)

That doesn’t mean you choose the easiest of easy degrees. For one, future employers will pay attention to the brand your university choice represents. They will also pay attention to what your subject is. You’ll probably find the easiest of easy degrees quite boring.

Having said that, some people suggest doing an easier degree which takes less of your time so that you can focus on career advancing activities in the spare time you free up ([this guy](http://tynan.com/hustle) takes this thought to its logical extreme). I suspect that for the vast majority of people this is a very bad idea. It requires strong internal sources of motivation. It seems far too likely that you’ll just end up doing your very easy degree and not taking advantage of the time to do productive work. I think you would need extremely good evidence that you’re highly internally motivated before you should do this (and most people are unlikely to get that evidence if they have only done schooling).

##Wrapping up

Degree choice matters no matter what you want to do, but it seems especially important for earning to give along a professional route and for research careers. In the former case, there are pretty clear paths set out that take little decision-making to pursue. In the latter case, it is also fairly clear but you should bias towards more mathematical ‘hard’ subjects and avoid artsy subjects in order to preserve flexibility.

In my [next post](http://80000hours.org/blog/143-how-to-choose-a-degree-what-do-employers-want) I’ll discuss the role of degree choice for more general careers.

_**ZR:** Can you describe a typical working week for you? How
many hours would you put in, what proportion of them would be spent on work you
find engaging and what on admin/other chores? More importantly, what,
physically do you do in what proportion from day to day? Can you give a sense
of the highs and lows of the job?_

**LM:** My work log says I've worked an average of 61 hours per
week since the beginning of September, when I was hired. This period covers a
transition from Research Fellow to Executive Director, so my "typical work
week" and the ratio between engaging/boring hours has changed over time. At the
moment, a typical work week consists of (1) managing the 80+ projects in my
Singularity Institute project tracker, along with all the staff members and
volunteers working on pieces of those projects, (2) taking calls and meetings
with advisors, supporters, volunteers, and external researchers, (3) writing
things like [So You Want to Save the
World](http://lukeprog.com/SaveTheWorld.html) and [Facing the
Singularity](http://facingthesingularity.com/contents/), and also internal
documents like a list of potential AI risk papers, and (4) working directly on
10-30 of our ongoing projects: everything from our forthcoming website redesign
to our [monthly progress reports](http://singinst.org/blog/) to strategy
meetings to improving our internal systems for communication and collaboration.

Physically, it's mostly working at a computer or sitting at a coffee or lunch meeting.

The highs come from doing things that appear to be reducing existential risk.

The lows come when I smack into the extreme complexity of the strategic
considerations concerning how to get from the world in its current state to a
world where people are basically happy and we _didn't_ destroy ourselves
with our ever-increasing technological powers. How do we get from here to
there? Even things you might think are "obviously" good might actually be bad
for complicated sociological and technological reasons. So, I often have a
nagging worry that what I'm working on only _seems_ like it's reducing
existential risk after the best analysis I can do right now, but actually
it's _increasing_ existential risk. That's not a pleasant feeling, but
it's the kind of uncertainty you have to live with when working on these
kinds of problems. All you can do is _try really hard_, and then try
[harder](http://lesswrong.com/lw/up/shut_up_and_do_the_impossible/).

Another low is being reminded every day that humans are quite capable of
"believing" that AI risk reduction is humanity's most important task without
actually _doing_ much about it. A few months after I [first
read](http://lesswrong.com/lw/8ib/connecting_your_beliefs_a_call_for_help/)
about intelligence explosion I said, "Well, damn, I guess I need to change my
whole life and help save the world," then quit my job and moved to Berkeley.
But humans rarely do things like that.

----
 
_**ZR:** What about a slightly atypical week? What sort of
events of note happen rarely, but reliably?_

**LM:** Once a year we put on our Singularity Summit, which for
about a month consumes most of our staff's time, including mine. When I need to
give a speech or finish a research paper, I will sometimes need to cut myself
away from everything else for a few days in order to zoom through the writing
and editing.
 
----

_**ZR:** SIAI seems to employ a number of philosophers, as its
more scientific researchers. Many readers of this blog will likely be midway
through philosophy or similar degrees, which might not lead easily to high
income careers. Suppose that they consider X-risk research as another option -
how plausible an option is it? Ie what proportion of postgraduate philosophy
students who take a specific interest in X-risk issues do you think will be
able to find work at SIAI or in similar organisations?_

**LM:** The number of x-risk organizations is growing, but they
are all quite funding-limited, so jobs are not easy to find. In most cases, a
skilled person can purchase more x-risk reduction by going into finance or
software or something else and _donating_ to x-risk organizations,
rather than by working directly for x-risk organizations. This is true for
[multiple reasons](http://vimeo.com/32787159).

Also, the _kind_ of philosophy you're trained in matters. If you're
trained in literary analysis and postmodern philosophy, that training won't
help you contribute to x-risk research. Somewhat less useless is training in
standard intuitionist analytic philosophy. The most relevant kind of philosophy
is naturalistic "formal philosophy" or the kind of philosophy that is almost
indistinguishable from the "hard" cognitive sciences.

Mathematicians and computer scientists are especially important for work on AI
risk. And physicists, of course, because physicists can do anything.
Naturalistic philosophers, mathematicians, computer scientists, and physicists
who want to work on x-risk should all contact me at
[luke@singularity.org](mailto:luke@singularity.org).

Especially if you can write and explain things. Genuine writing ability is
extremely rare.

----
 
_**ZR:** Can you describe roughly the breakdown of different
types of specialist who SIAI employs, so that anyone wanting to dedicate
themselves to working for you can see what the most plausible routes in are?
Are there any other relevant factors they should be aware of? (eg you employ
more people from field x than y, but so many people from x apply that it makes
y a better prospect)_

**LM:** More important than our current staff composition is who
we _want_ to hire. The most important and difficult hires we need to
make are people who can solve [the fundamental
problems](http://lukeprog.com/SaveTheWorld.html) in decision theory,
mathematics, and AI architectures that must be solved for Friendly AI to be
possible. These are people with extremely high mathematical ability:
gold-medalists in the International Math Olympiad, or people who ranked top 10
on the Putnam, for example. For short, we refer to this ideal team as "9 young
John Conways" + [Eliezer Yudkowsky](http://yudkowsky.net/), but that's not to
say we know that 9 is the best number nor that they all need exactly the same
characteristics of a young [John
Conway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway). We also need a
math-proficient
[Oppenheimer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer) to manage the
team.

Most young elite mathematicians do not realize that "save the world" is a
career option for them. I want to get that message out there.

----

_**ZR:** Overall, what would you say is the primary limiting
factor in attaining SIAI’s goals? In other words, would someone keen to help
you by any means necessary do better by going into professional philanthropy
and donating to you, or by training themselves in the skills you look for,
assuming they could expect to be about equivalently successful in either route?
(or some third option I haven’t thought of?)_

**LM:** Funding is our main limiting factor. The possible
non-existence of 9 young John Conways is another limiting factor. But if we
could find the right people, it's actually not that expensive to take a shot at
saving the world once and for all with a tightly-focused team of elite
mathematicians. The cost could be as low as $5 million per year, which is far
less than is spent on cosmetics research every year. Unfortunately, humanity's
funding priorities are self-destructive.

----

## Considerations for philanthropists

_**ZR:** Givewell &amp; Giving What We Can’s research has
tended to focus on health interventions, since QALYs and similar offer simple
metrics for judging how well each organisation does at achieving the underlying
goal. It’s understandable given the data available, but makes it tough for
people considering other types of cause. So I’ll throw the challenge over to
you - treating your goal simply as reducing X-risk, can you think of any
measure by which someone could evaluate how effective you guys are? - ie the
effect of a dollar spent on SIAI vs FHI vs one spent on something more
conventional with a similar goal? (CND or asteroid defence, for example)_

**LM:** Alas, there is no QALY-like unit for measuring existential
risk reduction! Measuring how much x-risk reduction is purchased per marginal
dollar invested in the Singularity Institute vs. the Future of Humanity
Institute vs. other organizations is difficult to measure. Rather than get into
a long and fuzzy analysis about that, I can approach this topic from another
angle. The short story is:

In the next two centuries we will have a multitude of chances to destroy
ourselves with powerful new technologies. AI looks like it may be one of the
first existential threats to be created. But unlike the others, doing AI
_right_ can actually _prevent_ the other existential risks from
happening. There is no more important thing humanity can do. So, prioritize
support for the organizations that look like understand the problem better than
everyone else and can make progress on it. Right now, the two most plausible
candidates for this are the Future of Humanity Institute and the Singularity
Institute.
 
----

_**ZR:** In a recent interview, Nick Bostrom was asked who he
would recommend giving to of SIAI and FHI given their similarities. His reply,
slightly paraphrased (Thanks to George McGowan for transcribing (and asking!) this.):_

> The two organizations have a lot of overlap in terms of their missions. They
> are pretty synergistic - and therefore if one were about to go under you should
> probably donate to that one. There is also a lot of collaboration between the
> two organizations - in papers we write and so on. However there are notable
> differences. SI doesn't have to deal with bureaucracy and try to get grants (as
> we do). They can also more easily hire people from non-academic backgrounds to
> do useful work. On the other hand - we have more influence in academia and turn
> out a greater number of papers. Our sights are on all x-risks, whereas SI
> focuses just on AI. So it's really a question of which set of characteristics
> you think are the most important.
 
_**ZR:** Do you agree with his answer? Is there anything you’d add to it?_

**LM:** Yes, actually. I made [roughly those same
comments](http://lesswrong.com/lw/7sc/siai_vs_fhi_achievements_20082010/4w6v)
about the synergy between the two organizations a few months before that Q&A
with Nick was posted online.

I think focusing on AI risk is most important, and Nick might actually agree.
He has spent much of the last year writing a book analyzing the AI risk
situation, and myself and others at the Singularity Institute have given him
comments on early drafts.

Just a question about career choice to fight AI x-risk. You seem to suggest there's one main choice: if you're a strong mathematician or physicist then consider working in AI research, otherwise you can probably do more by earning money and donating it to AI research. Most people don't have the research option, so generally professional philanthropy is the best way to go.

But have you considered some of the other options? For instance, you could persuade people to donate to AI research. If you give up a high earning career, but persuade 2 people to take high earning careers and donate toAI research, then you've made more difference. That seems very easy, given how few people donate to AI research. So this seems better than pro phil. And there are probably other extremely effective things you could involving advocacy.

A slightly different option would be anything that improves the effectiveness of AI researchers. A great manager might be able to make 10 researchers 10% more effective, and thus do as much good as becoming one himself.

Thanks for the interview - really interesting.

The difficult thing is estimating by how much a research program reduces x-risk. As Luke points out, it's sometimes not clear whether the SingInst increases or decreases the risk of dangerous AI! On the other hand, because even a tiny reduction in the probability of extinction is (if you place value on future people) an extremely good thing, so long as the research program is having a positive effect, it seems like a good bet that it's among the very best causes. ]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Welcome to the Blog... </title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/2-welcome-to-the-blog</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[... wherein we’ll post a variety of pieces new and classic on any topics that

If you’re reading this, I’ll assume you’re convinced by the philosophy of 80,000 Hours - so you won’t find an argument for that philosophy here. This post is just to help you decide where to best give your money right now, based on the combined recommendations of the above organisations allowing for a couple of factors they don’t address. 

So... plenty of organisations want your money, but a select few really stand out. What’s the best option?

Honestly, we don’t know yet. Thanks to GiveWell and Giving What We Can, efficient philanthropy has become much easier in the last couple of years, but they might still find better causes. Their recommendations overlap, but are far from equivalent, partly because of the different values they espouse. However, their work has already been so useful that using it to give now is literally thousands of times better than using the best evaluators was only a few years ago, which focused only on admin costs and ignored what the charities were actually trying to achieve.

So below is a list of groups you might consider supporting, in no particular order, why they’re a top candidate, and at the end some considerations to help you decide between them. I’ve kept the summaries brief and linked to more information at the bottom.

----

## [Against Malaria Foundation](http://www.againstmalaria.com/)

AMF provides treated malaria nets to high-risk populations. It’s Givewell’s top charity recommendation for 2011, and a top-tier one for GWWC.

### Why AMF?

* Simply the reason above - no other charity scores as well in both organisations’ ranking.
* As of the latest update to this post, they have the best cost/life years ratio according to according to Nick Beckstead, GWWC's head researcher : '$25/DALY.  Know that optimistic estimates put it at $10/DALY, but they are probably wrong.' (Givewell prefer to avoid the DALY metric)

----

## [Schistosomiasis Control Initiative](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto/) (SCI) 

SCI focuses exclusively on curing people of parasitic worms that cause very unpleasant deformities (Google ‘Schistosomiasis’ in an image search for some examples - I won’t subject you
to them here); it’s recommended by both Givewell and Giving What We Can. It has an awful name, though - perhaps the reason it’s been so underfunded.

###Why SCI?

* SCI probably offer the second-cheapest health intervention - '$20-$170/DALY, with wide uncertainty' (note this estimate has changed a lot from the original amount). 
* Besides its health benefits, SCI seems to be a great boon for education. One public paper estimates that for every US$3.27 you donate, you’ll be effectively buying an [extra year of schooling](http://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/primary-school-deworming-kenya?pid=21) for would’ve-been sufferers. Givewell have written a [critical appraisal](http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming#Developmentalimpacts) of such papers, suggesting that they overstate the case. They don't estimate by how much, but conclude that it's 'highly plausible that deworming has subtle but significant developmental effects that improve quality of later life'.

----

## [Vegan Outreach](http://www.veganoutreach.org/)
I know, the V-word. Stop backing away - it’s not (quite) what you think. VO’s
mission is to persuade people to become vegan by being a good example of
friendly vegans. They print and distribute leaflets that appeal to calm reason (and
yes, emotion) to convince people to switch to a vegan lifestyle in the US,
where farming laws are lax enough that meat eating is arguably more harmful
than anywhere else.


###Why Vegan Outreach?

* If you believe that animals’ suffering is similar in kind to humans’, even if not in degree, and if you take VO’s data about their success rate at face value, then this is a clear winner. According to Alan Dawrst’s [summary of their claims](http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/dollar-worth.pdf) (PDF. See section 5), $1 prevents between 100 days and 51 years of factory farm suffering.

* Because of the huge impact of the livestock industry on climate change, this is currently the closest thing to an environmental charity on the recommendations list. Though the degree of difference is controversial, more vegans means [lower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock's_Long_Shadow) [greenhouse gas emissions](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421511010603).

* Similarly, though independently, reducing our meat consumption also means
  we use [less freshwater](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2008/08/the-truth-about-saving-water/).

----

## [Givewell](http://www.givewell.org/about/donate) themselves

Unlike GWWC, Givewell accept direct donations. You can select for these either to go exclusively to their top charity pick(s) (aka re-granting). Alternatively, you can leave it up to them where the money goes, including operating expenses for them (aka unrestricted).

### Why Givewell?

* If you give money to them for re-granting, it’s going to be much the same as donating it to their top charities directly (DD). In favour of going via Givewell is the chance of them getting new data in the interim, which means they can redirect your money to a better cause than their current best. It might also have [benefits for tax deduction](http://blog.givewell.org/2012/01/13/how-tax-deductions-and-processing-fees-make-it-harder-to-give-well/), depending on which country you live in. Against it is the delay, and slight extra processing requirement - if you’re you know where they’ll give your money, there’s little reason to complicate the process. 
* Given how much value Givewell have had in redirecting philanthropic funds to ever more effective causes, giving them the option to expand their operations could pay huge dividends. This seems strictly superior to not giving them that option, assuming you trust their honesty and competence - and they’ve never given any reason for us to doubt either. Obviously it doesn’t force them to do so, so the benefit over re-granting could be miniscule. So, If you think re-granting seems substantially inferior to DD, you should probably still go with DD.

----

##Diversification
One further possibility remains. I’ve been talking about ‘the best’ cause,
but could all of these groups be worth giving a fraction of your donation to? 

I think this is the wrong approach. Steven Landsburg has already argued this,
so I’ll simply point to his essay [‘Giving Your All’](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/everyday_economics/1997/01/giving_your_all.html).

##Speculative causes / wait and see

Giving What We Can give mild recommendations of a couple of indirect aid organisations, to wit the research-oriented [Sabin vaccine institute](http://www.sabin.org/) and the advocacy organisation [RESULTS](http://www.results.org/about/) on the grounds that they offer ‘a potentially more significant return’ than its current recommendations. 

In the end, it sounds as though the [expected value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) of donating to either group is lower than the others I’ve discussed above, so there’s no rational reason to give to these groups at the moment. 

But if you’re considering investing your money to donate later, this makes that option seem slightly stronger. If either of these organisations do turn out to be better than the current recommendations, then it _might_ be better to give them a lump sum later. That said, there are numerous considerations behind choosing [whether to donate now or later](http://80000hours.org/blog/10-delayed-gratification-choosing-when-to-donate), so this should only sway you if you already thought the decision was a close one.

##Final Considerations

Hopefully, the recommendations of different groups will align more over time, and then it will be obvious which cause to give to, at least until they’re so successful they don’t need your money as much.

Meanwhile, choosing between these options will likely depend on your values. Some key considerations:

* GiveWell and Giving What We Can employ different research methodologies, so they reach different conclusions. Perhaps the main difference between the groups in that GiveWell rate transparency as a plus in itself, whereas GWWC are interested in it only in that it makes for higher uncertainty. Presumably Elie and Holden (the GiveWell founders) wouldn’t say that
  transparency is an ultimate virtue, but they’ve pointed out that their focus encourages greater honesty in the long run. You can see extensive (but unfinished) discussions between the two groups in the comments following [these threads](http://blog.givewell.org/2010/03/19/cost-effectiveness-estimates-inside-the-sausage-factory/). Givewell's Holden Karnofsky emailed me re this comparison, suggesting that it gives too much weighting to GWWC's estimates. While it seems unlikely that the recommendation of each organisation should be taken as equally valuable, I wouldn't want to retract the comparison without hearing a similar evaluation from GWWC researchers (which I'll seek for the next update), but I'll quote Holden's response in full:

> The links pointed to here are pretty old and we think there are now better places to get a feel for the orgs' differences. One is [http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/resources/our-methodology.php](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/resources/our-methodology.php).
> While there are some subtle differences in the values of the two groups, we don't feel these can be said to be the primary differences. The primary difference, in our view, is that GiveWell invests substantially more person-hours in its recommendations and publishes the full details of its analysis. 
> As stated at the link above, Giving What We Can's current recommendations are based largely on information and analysis provided by GiveWell (the reverse does not hold); GWWC's future plan is to seek to add value by explicitly focusing on areas where GiveWell is not working, i.e., to supplement rather than duplicate the work GiveWell does. Also note that GWWC's main "charity recommendations" page states that it "might follow GiveWell" in deciding between the top three charities. 
> All this considered, we feel it is not accurate at this point to portray the two groups as following independent methodologies whose conclusions can be taken as support of each other. 

* The GiveWell founders Elie and Holden have both said they consider animal welfare [relatively unimportant](http://blog.givewell.org/2010/12/27/animal-welfare-charities/), whereas Giving What We Can have focused their research on health intervention so far, so while Alan Dawrst is a solo researcher, the bigger groups’ failure to endorse Vegan Outreach might not tell us much.

* While the effects of parasitic worms are deeply unpleasant, they’re seldom fatal. GWWC have taken this into account in their estimates, but it means that while the other interventions actually save people’s lives, SCI and ‘only’ tend to improve them. In my view that makes SCI's intervention likely to be slightly underrated, but that's an argument for another post...

* The causes here are only the ones whose results have been fairly well examined - whicheans they’re biased towards groups whose goals are easily measurable. Plenty of other causes are potentially as important or more, from the familiar (political campaigning, medical research), to the more controversial (research into [human extinction](http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/ ), developing genuine [artificial intelligence](http://singinst.org/)). We’ll look at these more in future posts.
                
That’s it from me. Tell me if I’ve missed anything, and I’ll try and keep this post up to date.

It’s up to you from here...

## What happened to..?

A few words on the charities that dropped off the list:

### Deworm the World

Giving what we can still rates SCI and DtW as top-tier, but while Givewell have evaluated both, they’ve only recommended the former. So for the time being, there seems little reason to give to a charity that, however good in its own right, is strictly dominated in evaluations by another - very similar - one.

### Stop TB

Both Givewell and GWWC have downgraded this - GWWC have simply dropped their lower-tier recommendations in favour of a clearer message, Givewell’s evaluation states that they ‘do not have a clear understanding of Stop TB's room for more funding’. It sounds as though this was a low-hanging fruit that might have been picked.

### Village Reach 

As with Stop TB, Givewell have downgraded this on the grounds that they’ve actually received so many donations most of the quick gains have been gotten.

The problem with the types of cause you list is that (like so many others I'd love to know about), their value is very hard to quantify.

How do-gooders can gain more from risky careers</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[Consider Sam, a software engineer at Google. His employer ranks highly in both quality-of-life and salary rankings. Sam is a great coder, and passionate about his work. But Sam is not satisfied: he is sorely tempted to take his savings and launch his own company. There are costs in taking the plunge: entrepreneurship would mean working harder, and investing time and money into a venture that might easily fail with nothing to show for it.  On the other hand, success would mean bringing his vision to life, and potentially a financial payoff far beyond what he could hope for as a salaried employee.

Considering just these factors, Sam isn’t sure which way to go, like many other talented technologists. But if one of Sam’s goals is making a big impact on the lives of others, that can tip the balance towards entrepreneurship. Here’s how.

# Taking risks and winning big

It’s common knowledge that entrepreneurship is risky business: many firms fold, some enjoy moderate success, and a few become enormous successes, making their founders billionaires. A study by Hall and Woodward, which tracked the fates of thousands of American startups after receiving venture capital investment, shows the strength of this skew. For two thirds of startups, the shareholdings of the founders wound up worth less than a million US (2006) dollars. Over 90% of the wealth gained by founders came from the top 10% of firms, those which returned over $10 million, and almost half the wealth came from the top 2% of firms, returning over $100 million. Thus, even though most firms failed, a randomly selected team of startup founders (with some VC funding) would on average earn $9.2 million by exit (IPO, sale of the company, or failure). The median time to exit was 49 months, with successes tending to exit earlier, so on average founding teams in this sample earned over $2 million per year, or a little over $1.4 million per year for each entrepreneur (some solo, some in teams).

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
<tr><th>Entrepreneurs’ exit value, millions of 2006 dollars</th>	<th>Percent of companies</th>	<th>Percent of total entrepreneurs’ exit value</th></tr>
<tr><td>0 to 1</td>	<td>67.4</td>	<td>0.7</td></tr>
<tr><td>1 to 10</td>	<td>19.7</td>	<td>7.7</td></tr>
<tr><td>10 to 50</td>	<td>8.6</td>	<td>22.3</td></tr>
<tr><td>50 to 100</td>	<td>2.4</td>	<td>18.4</td></tr>
<tr><td>100 to 200</td>	<td>1.3</td>	<td>19.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>200 to 500</td>	<td>0.5</td>	<td>15.9</td></tr>
<tr><td>500 to 1000</td>	<td>0.1</td>	<td>9.1</td></tr>
<tr><td>1000 and higher</td>	<td>0.03</td>	<td>6.9</td></tr>
</table>

# What would I do with a tenth Ferrari?
Your first pair of shoes does you much more good than the 47th. Your first cell phone is much more valuable than your third. Your first house is much more valuable than a second. Your first hundred million dollars spent on consumption is much more valuable than your second (since you bought the best buys with the first). In economic terms, people have [diminishing marginal utility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility#Diminishing_marginal_utility) in money.

So, if all Sam wants is personal consumption, a $120,000 job at Google does pretty well: a nice car, a nice home, and sushi lunches. A chance at making much more as an entrepreneur, even if much higher in expected wealth, might still not be a very good deal because if the venture fails he will have to cut back his spending somewhat, although he would not be impoverished and could just go back to work as a software engineer.

When Woodward and Hall adjust the payoffs to entrepreneurs in their data for risk to reflect this, i.e. when they ask how much people with different levels of risk-aversion should be willing to pay to get the returns of a randomly selecting founding team, the expected returns to founders are slashed. Using standard estimates of [risk aversion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion#Relative_risk_aversion) the expected value of the payout to a founding team from their stockholding is cut by over 90%.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
<tr><th>Coefficient of relative risk aversion (CRRA)</th><th>Non-stochastic equivalent of venture payoff, millions of dollars</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td>	<td>9.2</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td>	<td>2.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td>	<td>.9</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td>	<td>0.6</td></tr>
</table>
Table 5, page 19, “[Incentive to Start New Companies: Evidence from Venture Capital](http://www.nber.org/papers/w13056),” Robert E. Hall and Susan E. Woodward; Working Paper 13056

When we further take into account that not all startups reach the point of getting venture capital funding (although Sam’s track record at Google suggests he is relatively apt), the risk-adjusted returns of a startup stake may be in the same ballpark as remaining a salaried employee, despite much higher unadjusted expected returns.

# What am I going to do with my tenth vaccine? Vaccinate another kid!
But Sam isn’t only interested in personal consumption. He also donates part of his salary to help support [highly effective charities](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/resources/recommended-charities.php). And while Sam’s 10th pair of shoes does him little additional good, a tenth donation can vaccinate a tenth child, or a pay for the work of a tenth scientist doing [high impact research](http://80000hours.org/blog/5-high-impact-science) such as vaccine development. So long as Sam’s donations don’t become huge relative to the cause he is working on (using up the most efficient donation opportunities) he can often treat a charitable donation of $1,000 as just as worthwhile as a 1 in 10 chance of a $10,000 donation.

Thus, instead of giving $10,000 from his Google salary, Sam could plan to give a larger amount if his startup is a success, e.g. half of the proceeds over $10 million. This is the basic theme of the [Giving Pledge](http://givingpledge.org/) that many billionaire entrepreneurs have been making recently. Such a plan could leave risk-adjusted personal spending the same, while also gaining a “free lunch” of far greater expected impact on the people Sam is helping. 

This “do-gooder bonus” for risky careers doesn’t mean they are right for everyone. Where Sam is torn, some will find that they prefer stability, or that their skills better match professions with less skewed outcomes. Additional information will raise or lower expected returns. But given the sheer size of the wedge between raw expected returns and risk-adjusted returns, it will sometimes be enough to make risk-taking and entrepreneurship the winning choice.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier></dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2012-01-08 14:15:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>158</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Brian Tomasik</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>brian.tomasik@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/brian-tomasik</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-01-13 08:41:48</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great post, Carl! Very compelling.

"so on average founding teams in this sample earned over $2 million per year, or a little over $1.4 million per year for each entrepreneur (some solo, some in teams)."This is earnings per year during venture funding? How long, on average, did it take to get venture funding? What if we include those who never got venture funding? This might give a more accurate estimate of the time taken to earn those dollars. We might also make an adjustment for the longer working hours for startup founders.

The Hall and Woodward paper suggests there aren't excess expected returns from venture-capital investing the way there are from founding a company. The authors conclude by saying, "General partners are sufficiently diversified across companies that their earnings are not nearly as exposed to idiosyncratic risk as entrepreneurs. Investors receive risk-adjusted returns comparable to those available from the stock market and other investments." Phew! At least financial-economic theory isn't always wrong. :)]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>153</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Zander Redwood</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>editor@80000hours.org</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/zander-redwood</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-01-08 15:05:43</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Quick note to apologise for the messy formatting of the second table ('Non-stochastic equivalent of venture payoff, millions of dollars' should be the header of the second column).

That way if 10 people went into entrepreneurship, they'd still expect to contribute a larger amount than if any smaller fraction of them had gone into salaried jobs, without the disincentive of personal downfall. If the number was large enough it would be virtually a guarantee.

In practice I don't know how you'd ensure that everyone joining was sincere. You'd also need some sort of competence/motivation testing, so that people with no realistic chance of entrepreneurial success wouldn't join.

The absence of such a support structure 'til the present day suggests that the obstacles to it are larger than it feels like they should be.

Perhaps a practical alternative would be several such microstructures, where people got together in small enough numbers to avoid some of the bureaucracy/abuse that would inevitably come with a single group of do-gooders.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1344</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Chris Hennick</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>seahen123@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/chris-hennick</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-09-27 11:51:44</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[An actuarially-valid competence test would be a big step forward in and of itself, since I don't know of any existing objective way to assess a venture's chances of success.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>154</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>155</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Benjamin Todd</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>benjamin.john.todd@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/benjamin-todd</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-01-08 17:59:02</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think this is a really interesting post.

In estimating the expected return for entrepreneurship, why do you use average salary but median time to exit?

2. I think most people can modify the expected value calculations somewhat. For example, I think I'm capable enough to create a successful startup, but I find it highly unlikely that I have the necessary prowess to make a startup that ends up in the top 2%. If I eliminate the possibility that my startup will reach the top 2%, that cuts the expected value in half. (It's still a lot higher than the expected value of almost any 9 to 5 job, though.)]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1345</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Chris Hennick</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>seahen123@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/chris-hennick</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-09-27 11:59:06</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Should impacts be reassigned to everyone who took a chance on earning them?

When we think about how to make a difference in our careers, it is natural to think about what we can do directly. We think about the children we could build schools for, the homeless person we could help, what campaigns we might take part in, and so on.

But what we do directly is not the only thing that matters. We also need to think about what _would_ have happened if we hadn’t acted – which is called a counterfactual.

Imagine you’re involved in a car accident. When you regain consciousness, you find that your mother is seriously injured. Paramedics have just arrived and are preparing to help her.

Suppose you believe that what’s important is what you can do directly. Therefore you shove the paramedics out of the way and start performing first aid on your mother. You’re not an expert, so although you save her life, you cause her permanent spine damage. 

If you had let the paramedics work, your parent would have fully recovered.

The consequence of your action is the difference between what happened as the result of your action and _what would have happened otherwise_. In this case, the consequence of your action was your mother suffering permanent spinal damage. This is why pushing the paramedics out of the way was wrong. 


### Consequences matter

When judging the goodness of an act, what you do directly matters, but so do consequences. 

Normally, performing life saving first aid on your parent would be the right thing to do. But in this case, since it results permanent spine damage, it seems pretty clear that it was the wrong thing to do.


### The tension in conventional ethical careers advice

When people discuss ethical careers, they often talk about ‘making a difference’ as the supposed reason for pursuing such a career.

So what does it mean to make a difference? ‘Making a difference’, if it means anything, means bringing about good things that wouldn’t have occurred otherwise. 

But then when people think about which careers are ethical, they often seem to focus on which careers do good directly – doctors, aid workers, campaigners etc.

But we’ve just seen that the good you do directly can be completely different from the difference you make.

80,000 Hours is distinctive because we take counterfactuals seriously – we want to bring about positive consequences that wouldn’t have happened otherwise: to _really_ make a difference. 

We care much less about whether what we do lines up with conventional notions of which careers are ethical. Indeed, we’re sceptical about taking many conventional ethical careers. 

That’s because careers that are normally thought to be ethical tend to be extremely competitive. That means that if you don’t take the job, someone else will take your place. And since the application process is so competitive, they’re likely to be almost as good at the job as you would have been – you’re replaceable. This holds unless you have particularly special talents, so can’t be replaced. Unless, in effect, you’re the paramedic at the car crash.

Most of us aren’t in that position. And that means the difference we would make by taking that ‘ethical’ career is almost zero; even though we might have done a lot of good directly.

So, we end by seeing a simple first step in finding a high impact career: if you want to make a difference, do something that wouldn’t have happened otherwise.

I'd have to disagree. Saving a life matters only in that the life of the person saved matters.

If you become a fundraisers, you won't raise extra money for charity. Rather, you'll shift money from one charity to another.

Suppose Oxfam spends an extra £1 on fundraising. We’d expect this to raise them at least £4[^1]. So, it looks like they’ve generated an extra £3 for charity. Great!

But what would have happened if they hadn’t spent that £1? If this was an easy opportunity to raise money, then another charity would take it instead. Charities as a whole are [raising about as much money as they can](http://80000hours.org/blog/92-why-don-t-charities-spend-more-on-fundraising) from the public. This is what we’d expect. Charities are aiming to do as much for their cause as possible, so if there were easy money to raise, they’d take it. And intuitively, people have a relatively stable ‘charity budget’ . They avoid future giving once they’ve ‘done their part.’

This means that Oxfam wasn’t actually generating new money for charity by doing more fundraising, rather, it was shifting it from somewhere else. So the extra fundraiser wasn’t doing any good[^2].

But it gets worse.

If you graph how [cost-effective](/donating) [charities](http://80000hours.org/blog/73-is-there-such-thing-as-a-bad-charity) are, you’d expect to find a curve a bit like the one on my very basic graphic below[^3]:

</br>

<center><a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/41/original/lognormal2_labelled.png?1349090730'><img alt="Lognormal2_labelled" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/41/medium/lognormal2_labelled.png?1349090730" /></a> </center>

</br>

The key point is that the median is significantly less than the mean. In other words, the effectiveness of the majority of charities is less than the effectiveness of the average charity. That sounds a bit odd, but it’s just because the average effectiveness is pulled up a long way by the small number of really good charities at the top. (Similarly, the average wage at a company is normally higher than what the majority of the staff are paid).

This means that most fundraisers at the margin are shifting money to charities that are less effective than the average charity. So, they are reducing the overall effectiveness of the charity sector. They are actually reducing how much good gets done!

It’s pretty likely that the effectiveness of the median charity[^4] is *significantly* less than the mean. It could easily be as low as one fifth[^5]. If it were one fifth, then even if every £1 of fundraising only caused 80p to move from the mean to the median, it would negate the good done by the £4 spent by the median. See below for the calculation[^6]. So, even if *most* of the money raised wouldn’t have been given by the public otherwise, no good is being done.

In fact, we’ve just seen that extra charity fundraising doesn’t cause much extra money to be given to charity. Most or perhaps almost all of the money is just shifted from other charities. Assuming the money comes from the mean charity, then the majority of fundraisers are shifting money from more effective causes to less, significantly reducing how much good is done by charity overall. The majority of fundraisers look like they’re doing good, but taking into account the indirect effects could mean they’re actually making the world worse off[^7].

Before we get carried away, it’s important to note that that fundraising *as a whole* is still doing good[^8]. Moreover, if you’re a fundraiser, and you’ve got no idea how effective your charity is, then you should expect it to have the *mean* effectiveness (not median). That means that if you become a fundraiser you should expect to be doing good (or at worst be neutral). If you’re working for a charity that’s more effective than the mean, then you’re doing a lot of good.

If, on the other hand, you’ve got reason to think that your charity is less effective than the mean, then please stop!

The reverse, however, is true for the minority of fundraisers who work for charities that are more cost-effective than the mean. They’re shifting money from less effective charities to more effective ones, potentially doing a huge amount of good.

[^1]: According to the Institute of Fundraising’s Fundratios survey:
http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/research/fundratios/

[^2]: More accurately, additional fundraising seems to cause additional giving of about £1.9, rather than £4, so the extra ‘profit’ to the charity sector is only 90p per £1. It’s not clear that this can go much lower, due to the risks of fundraising. So, fundraisers probably cause *some* extra money to be donated to charity, but it’s much less than it looks.
http://80000hours.org/blog/92-why-don-t-charities-spend-more-on-fundraising
The nation’s charity budget is equal to about 1.1% of GDP. http://www.philanthropyuk.org/resources/us-philanthropy
Of course, there may still be ways to significantly increase how much is given to charity in total. It’s just that it would require a new approach. In fact, we’re very hopeful that 80,000 Hours and GWWC are one of these new approaches.

[^3]: We’d expect the distribution of interventions theoretically to be log-normal because most characteristics that make for an effective intervention will be distributed normally. The total effectiveness will arise from the product of all these characteristics. Multiplying normal distributions gives you a log-normal distribution.
This has direct empirical support. The DCP2 found that health interventions were log-normally distributed. The most effective intervention generated 300 DALY per $1000, while the least generated only 0.02. The median intervention generated about 5. The mean generated about 25.
There is a difference, however, between the distribution of interventions and the distribution of charity effectiveness. If we assume that charities choose interventions randomly (which might not be so bad an assumption), then the distributions would be the same. However, it seems like charities care at least a little about effectiveness. This will mean that the distribution of charities will move further to the right. We’d expect, however, for it to still have that kind of shape.


[^4]: Or more accurately, the average effectiveness of all charities that are less effective than the mean. By taking using the, we’re making an underestimate of the gap.

[^5]: For the health interventions in the DCP, the median effectiveness was about 5, while the mean was 25. We’d expect the mean in practice to be slightly less due to reversion to the mean. On the other hand, if we’re considering all types of intervention (rather than just health), the overall dispersion will be much larger, making the gap between the mean and the median significantly higher again. So, assuming the median effectiveness is about one fifth of mean effectiveness is likely to be an overestimate.

[^6]:
* Let the median charity have an effectiveness of 1 unit/£, where ‘1 unit’ is just whatever is of value in the area being considered, for instance ‘healthy people.’
* The mean charity has an effectiveness of 5 unit/£
* The median spends £1 on fundraising, and raises £4
* £3.20 is money that wouldn’t have been given otherwise, 80p is moved from the mean charity to the median
* In reality, the median charity spends the (4-1) = £3 of ‘profit’, creating 3x1 = 3 units of value
* But if they hadn’t fundraised, then the mean charity would have had an extra 80p. It would have cost them 20p to raise this money, so they would have had an extra 60p to spend. This would have produced 0.6x5=3 units of value
* So, no good has been done overall

[^7]:
More realistic figures:
* The median spends £1 on fundraising, and raises £4
* £0.50 is money that wouldn’t have been given otherwise, £3.50 is moved from the mean charity to the median
* The £3 of ‘profit’ creates 3x1 = 3 units of value at the median charity
* But if they hadn’t fundraised, then the mean charity would have had an extra £3.50. Subtracting the fundraising cost of 90p, means it would have produced 2.6x5 = 13 units of value.
* So, the median charity is overall causing the loss of 13 - 3 = 10 units of value. Impressively, this loss is over three times as large as the good they apparently do directly.

But many pairs of charities are working to push some social indicator or phenomenon in opposite directions, e.g. pushing for conflicting policy proposals, or increasing and decreasing population.

Moreover, it doesn't actually rely on marginal fundraising causing NO extra money to be donated to charity. Because the difference between mean and median is likely to be so large, if even a small amount is moved from another charity (as opposed to wouldn't have been donated otherwise) then it's likely to be net harmful.

The seemingly trivial decision of whether to pay by cheque or credit card may affect both these factors, so it’s worth considering which payment method will help you do the most good.

Consider the fees that are charged on credit-card transactions. The largest of these is the interchange fee, which in the US is typically [1 to 3 percent](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/your-money/credit-and-debit-cards/05visa.html?_r=1&em=&pagewanted=all). American interchange fees, however, are anomalously high: in the UK the average fee is just 0.79% (see the chart in [this article](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/01/12/will-us-courts-take-aim-at-credit-card-interchange/) for other countries’ rates). Depending on how much you give and where you live, you could end up paying hundreds of dollars to the bank that issued your credit card. 

Several organisations, including the [Schistosomaiasis Control Initiative](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto/donate) and [Vegan Outreach](http://www.veganoutreach.org/about/donate.html), have arrangements that allow them to avoid paying these fees. If the organisation that you’re donating to can avoid fees, the convenience of credit-card donations may make them the best choice. This is especially true if you receive incentives for credit-card purchases, such as cashback or airline miles.

Credit-card fees are relatively small, though, and they probably aren’t the most important determinant of how you should pay for your donations. Psychological effects are likely to have a larger impact on your giving.

One relevant psychological factor is the tendency to spend more money when paying for things by credit card than by cheque. This additional spending is part of the reason that most businesses don’t charge extra for credit-card purchases or offer rebates to customers who pay by cheque or in cash, even though businesses must pay fees on credit-card transactions. Experimental evidence provides additional support for this hypothesis. In one study (Prelec and Simester 2001), participants bid on sports tickets. Those who were told that they would have to pay with a credit card if they won the auction were willing to pay about twice as much as those who were told that their payment would have to be in cash.

In another study (Feinberg 1986), subjects were falsely told they were taking part in an experiment related to ‘impression formation’ and were seated alone at a table in a faculty member’s office. The researchers had placed credit-card insignias and replicas on the tables at which some of the participants sat. After a few minutes, a stranger knocked at the door and asked for a donation to the United Way. Subjects exposed to the credit-card materials were more likely to give, and they gave in larger amounts. 

This finding is surprising given that other research has shown that priming people with the idea of money (eg, by seating them in front of a computer screen that showed notes floating in water) reduces their willingness to help others (Vohs, Mead, and Goode 2006).

A second psychological factor is specific to recurring credit-card donations, which have the advantage of making giving the default option. It takes extra effort _not_ to give, so people who have set up recurring donations are likely to give more. On the other hand, the automatic nature of these donations might detract from the psychological satisfaction of giving.

Recurring donations have a second possible downside: the same inertia that encourages people to keep giving also encourages them to keep giving to the same organisation even if a better giving opportunity comes along. 

After giving to UNICEF for a few years, I found out about GiveWell and its donation recommendations. But I waited almost a year before cancelling my UNICEF recurring donations. If I’d had to write a cheque or fill out an online form every month, I probably would have shifted my donations to a more effective organisation sooner. So if you haven’t done much research on which charities are most effective or if your feelings are in flux, it might be wise to stick to one-time donations.

Though recurring credit-card donations make giving easier, it might be better to pledge to give a certain percentage of your income. Then how much you give will be the result of conscious deliberation rather than the vagaries of individual psychology. Even if you make a giving pledge, though, it’s possible that you would give more if you were paying with a credit card than by cheque, and it’s important to take into account the fees deducted from credit-card donations.

In the words of Eliezer Yudkowsky (edited slightly to make sense of today not being September 26):

> September 26th is Petrov Day, celebrated to honor the deed of Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov on September 26th, 1983.  Wherever you are on that day, whatever you're doing, take a minute to not destroy the world.
>
> The story begins on September 1st, 1983, when Soviet jet interceptors shot down a Korean Air Lines civilian airliner after the aircraft crossed into Soviet airspace and then, for reasons still unknown, failed to respond to radio hails.  269 passengers and crew died, including US Congressman Lawrence McDonald.  Ronald Reagan called it ‘barbarism’, ‘inhuman brutality’, ‘a crime against humanity that must never be forgotten’.  Note that this was already a very, very poor time for US/USSR relations.  Andropov, the ailing Soviet leader, was half-convinced the US was planning a first strike.  The KGB sent a flash message to its operatives warning them to prepare for possible nuclear war.
>
> On September 26th, 1983, Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov was the officer on duty when the warning system reported a US missile launch.  Petrov kept calm, suspecting a computer error.
>
> Then the system reported another US missile launch.
>
> And another, and another, and another.
>
> What had actually happened, investigators later determined, was sunlight on high-altitude clouds aligning with the satellite view on a US missile base. 
>
> In the command post there were beeping signals, flashing lights, and officers screaming at people to remain calm.  According to several accounts I've read, there was a large flashing screen from the automated computer system saying simply "START" (presumably in Russian). Afterward, when investigators asked Petrov why he hadn't written everything down in the logbook, Petrov replied, ‘Because I had a phone in one hand and the intercom in the other, and I don't have a third hand.’
>
> The policy of the Soviet Union called for launch on warning.  The Soviet Union's land radar could not detect missiles over the horizon, and waiting for positive identification would limit the response time to minutes.  Petrov's report would be relayed to his military superiors, who would decide whether to start a nuclear war.
>
> Petrov decided that, all else being equal, he would prefer not to destroy the world.  He sent messages declaring the launch detection a false alarm, based solely on his personal belief that the US did not seem likely to start an attack using only five missiles.
>
> Petrov was first congratulated, then extensively interrogated, then reprimanded for failing to follow procedure.  He resigned in poor health from the military several months later.  According to Wikipedia, he is spending his retirement in relative poverty in the town of Fryazino, on a pension of $200/month.  In 2004, the Association of World Citizens gave Petrov a trophy and $1000.  There is also a movie scheduled for release in 2012 (possibly now out? It’s hard to tell from [its website]( http://www.logtv.com/films/redbutton/index.htm) - ZR), entitled The Red Button and the Man Who Saved the World.
>
> Maybe someday, the names of people who decide not to start nuclear wars will be as well known as the name of Britney Spears.  Looking forward to such a time, when humankind has grown a little wiser, let us celebrate, henceforth, Petrov Day.

The Institute of Fundraising and the Centre for Interfirm Comparison publish a yearly report called ‘[FundRatios](http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/research/fundratios/)’, with statistics on returns on investment, growth and other fundraising statistics.

In their 2010 report they found that for every £1 invested in fundraising charities receive £4.03 in donations. But some forms of fundraising are much more effective; for every £1 invested in asking people to leave the charity a legacy in their will (‘legacy fundraising’) about £25 will be donated to the charity, and some years the figure is much higher.

The exuberant fundraiser on the street who tries to get people to sign up to a monthly direct debit may actually be making a large amount of money for their charity. The average donor they sign up stays with their charity for about 5 years and donates around £8 a month, if their donations qualify for gift aid this can add about an extra 25% too.

Street fundraisers usually average a few ‘sign ups’ per day, maybe between 2 and 4, and the 2010 FundRatios report finds that it costs charities £87 to get one new “committed giver”.

So one street fundraiser who signs up 2 donors who each give £8 a month for 5 years is effectively making about £786 for their charity in one day!


**Managing fundraisers**

Street fundraising itself might not be an optimal career for effective altruists. Finding new people to fundraise probably isn’t particularly difficult so the marginal benefit of becoming another could be very small. On the other hand it might be more difficult to find people to work for the charity and manage these fundraisers.

Suppose a charity is doing a marketing appeal over the phone, looking for people to donate, and suppose these donations come in almost immediately. If the charity’s only costs are employee salaries then it seems as if they could fundraise and then pay their employees from the money they’ve just made. Because of this they could theoretically employ an almost infinite number of fundraisers. 

Perhaps this money could be re-invested in fundraising and the charity can grow more. This could be especially good for charities whose goal it is to raise awareness of an issue.

However suppose a charity is doing door to door fundraising (which can make over £3 for a charity for every £1 invested). The fundraisers might need to be spread out over a large geographical area and it might be necessary to have more people managing these fundraisers, or starting new branches of the charity in different areas as it grows. 

Maybe these people could simply be hired and don’t need to be effective altruists, but maybe this wouldn’t work; this might be a good career for effective altruists.

Unfortunately it’s not all good news; if people just switch to your charity from one that would have done the same amount of good with the money then it’s pointless. But if your charity is significantly better than the charities you expect to take money from it makes this less of a concern.

I hope people will look into this more as there are still loads of questions to be answered, at any rate it seems like managing fundraising may be a very ethical career.

---------------

NOTES:

I spoke to a representative from the [Public Fundraising Regulatory Association](http://www.pfra.org.uk/) who said that after 3 months 25% of donors have stopped giving, at the end of the year another 25% had stopped, and that about 1 or 2% stop giving every month after this. 

This seems worrying, and seems to go against everything else I’ve read.  Maybe many of the donations increase and the average still equals 5 years. The FundRatios 2010 report says that ‘on average, 12% of existing committed givers increased their contribution during the year compared to just 7% in the previous year. The average increase was £33 a year or just under £3 a month.’ Maybe this explains it.

Just a small note. Gift aid on basic rate tax in the UK is 25% of the amount donated. This seems strange, since the basic rate of income tax is 20%, but it breaks down like this:

£100 of income above personal allowance and below higher rate limit (roughly £40k/annum).
£20 goes in income tax, so the post tax income (ignoring national insurance, since this can't be claimed back, but would be £12 in our example) is £80. Let's say I give all of that money away and claim back the tax in gift aid - the tax collected back would be £20, which is 25% of what I've donated.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>372</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Ruairí Donnelly</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>rd5683@hotmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/ruairi-donnelly</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-05-31 23:37:41</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Eitan, yes I imagine it's probably harder to get donors for non-human animal charities, I'm reading "change of heart" by Nick Cooney at the moment and he says that in the U.S only 2% of donations go to non-human animal causes.

I bet effective fundraisers can make a huge difference but if we just hire them from outside of our effective-altruist-community-thing then theres a big marginal benefit and a good chance we may as well hire someone to do the work and do something else ourselves :)

It'd be a curious case if virtually any charity could simply hire more fundraisers to increase its funds. I suspect that this varies widely from one charity sector to another. For instance, it seems that the potential donors to certain very effective animal welfare or existential risk charities do not consist of an unlimited, untapped pool. In fact, a relatively large proportion of that pool is probably already mostly tapped into. 

What this means is that there will be a point (and perhaps that point is very near) where the optimal strategy for a charity would be to increase the number of its potential donors (i.e. sympathetic income-earners), before hiring more fundraisers to tap into that pool. 
Of course, with clever messaging, a charity could successfully solicit donations from the general public even if individuals are not entirely gung-ho about the cause. I think in crafting these kinds of appeals, effective fundraisers can make a world of a difference.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Good generals let their soldiers die in vain</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/107-good-generals-let-their-soldiers-die-in-vain</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[In November 1914 Winston Churchill proposed a campaign to turn the tide of war on the Eastern Front. The plan was to fight a land war up the Gallipoli peninsula, secure safe passage for warships up the Dardanelles, and give the Russians access to the Mediterranean.

<center><a title="By Boldair at fr.wikipedia [Public domain], from Wikimedia Commons" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AIllustration_par_Carrey_pour_le_journal_Le_Miroir_en_1915.jpg"><img width="256" alt="Illustration par Carrey pour le journal Le Miroir en 1915" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Illustration_par_Carrey_pour_le_journal_Le_Miroir_en_1915.jpg/256px-Illustration_par_Carrey_pour_le_journal_Le_Miroir_en_1915.jpg"/></a></center>

The land war was a total failure. After landing in April 1915 the Allied troops lost momentum quickly. By August Ottoman forces had tied them into static trench warfare. The Allies couldn’t make any more progress, they had achieved nothing and 220,000 soldiers had died. It was at this point that the allied troops were ordered to evacuate.

Some soldiers said they hoped their dead comrades wouldn’t notice them leaving. The 220,00 soldiers died “in vain”. And yet it was a great decision by Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Monro to let them die in vain. **Better that than lose even more men pointlessly.**

Why is it so clear to everyone than soldiers dying in vain is more tragic than soldiers dying otherwise? Why is it so hard to accept that Monro made the right decision?

##The sunk cost bias

The “[sunk cost bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs)” is the tendency to keep doing something that doesn’t make sense anymore, just because of how much you’ve already paid for it. When that cost is as enormous as people’s deaths this bias is overpowering. It would be the obvious thing to do to refuse to fight an unwinnable battle. But we feel that it’s a mistake, or even immoral, to turn away from the same fight when people have already died.

The sunk cost bias is very stubborn. History is filled with stories of generals not as wise as Monro. Generals who refused to let the deaths of their soldiers be in vain and fought on regardless of the odds. **These generals are almost always on the losing side,** and they take far more men to the grave with them than could ever be justified. And yet this temptation is still strong. That strength of feeling is due to the power of sunk costs.

Sadly for soldiers everywhere many of the ways you might expect to fight sunk costs wouldn’t work:

* Folk psychology is aware of it, but even after advice to **“cut your losses”** and **“not throw good money after bad”** we still act according to this bias.
* The evidence doesn’t suggest that simply thinking very hard about the decision will help.[^1]
* It doesn’t seem like talking it over with other people will help.[^2]
* It isn’t even clear that knowing about the sunk cost bias will help very much.[^3]


The Battle of Gallipoli was unwinnable. Luckily the battle against sunk costs is not. Next time we’ll look at how sunk costs bias impacts on career choice and how you can overcome it.

> The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to
> death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a
> substantial increase in the world death rate.

Ehrlich predicted the deaths as a consequence of the challenge of feeding a
rapidly growing world population, pointing to recent devastating famines in
South Asia. But even as those words were written, the fields were being planted
with new, higher-yielding semi-dwarf strains of wheat and rice.  Combined with
modern fertilizers and other methods, these strains ushered in the [“Green
Revolution”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_revolution): wheat production
in India and Pakistan almost doubled between 1965 and 1970, and formerly
famine-wracked countries became self-sufficient in food and have not seen such
hunger since.  The agronomist Norman Borlaug, who developed new and more
effective methods of plant breeding, used them to develop the key strain of
wheat, and brought about expansion of his methods to other crops and deployment
in South Asia, played a pivotal role.
Some [credit him](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/01/forgotten-benefactor-of-humanity/6101/)
with saving a billion lives, referring to the number of people fed by the
increase agricultural production of the Green Revolution.  Indisputably,
scientific and technological advances and technological innovation have brought
about almost incredible amounts of good.

##Not whether, but when?

However, when we ask how we can effectively do good in our careers, the key
question is not how much scientific research on the whole has made the world
better: it is “how do I expect the world to be different if I take up this
career, rather than another one?” If Norman Borlaug had never lived his
discoveries would eventually have been made by others.  Continued food scarcity
would have evoked both market and government responses in increased research.
Fertilizers and other agricultural technologies would have been applied without
enhanced crop varieties, capturing some of the Green Revolution’s benefits.  We
should think of achievements like Borlaug’s as bringing about technologies
faster, rather than making them possible at all.

However, tremendous impacts are possible through speeding the pace of progress,
even slightly.  According to the
[WHO](http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/malaria2010_summary_keypoints_en.pdf),
malaria killed over 781,000 people in 2009. If current trends continue,
advances in vaccines, bednets, mosquito control, and increased deployment
efforts will likely eventually drive down fatalities to zero.  But leaping
ahead in this process by a single year could save 781,000 lives.  A single
day’s speedup would save 2,139 lives.  Advancing the process by even 40 seconds
would save a life.  Then the question becomes: how many seconds can you expect
to advance your field over your career?

Norman Borlaug advanced progress on a massive issue by years, a truly
exceptional achievement that very likely saved millions of lives or more over
time.  But far more scientists, working on important but neglected problems,
could each hope to do good comparable to moving malaria eradication forward
several days.  Such an achievement could do as much good as donating millions
of pounds to apply existing vaccines or drugs. 

##How much can I advance my field?

When we consider donating to administer treatments for tuberculosis or malaria,
we can measure lives saved through randomized experiment: administer the
treatment to half of a study population at random, and see how many more
members of the vaccinated group remain healthy.  Estimating the impact of
individual research contributions is harder.

It’s easy to measure inputs such as R&D funding and scientific workforce.  For
instance, [spending on malaria
R&D](http://www.malariavaccine.org/files/RD-report-June2011.pdf) was $612
million in 2009, after doubling from 2004 levels thanks to increased spending
by the Gates Foundation and United States NIAID.  So one can fairly easily find
out whether adding one’s brain or donations to the field will boost the
relevant inputs by 10% or by 0.01%, and rephrase questions about impact of
additional researchers in terms of the speed increase from a percentage
resource increase.  Will doubling R&D budgets cut development time by at least
10%? 2%? 0.2%? Phrased in this way, it is easier to draw on other knowledge to
judge the plausibility of potential impacts.

When a
[panel](http://www.rethinkhiv.com/priorities/113-georgetown-university-expert-panel)
convened by the [RethinkHIV](http://www.rethinkhiv.com/priorities) initiative,
which performed cost-benefit analysis of a number of HIV/AIDS interventions,
[turned to HIV vaccine
research](http://www.rethinkhiv.com/images/Papers/111118141329-ccc93b191d114d1fb9b1dd3cc7c49e5e.pdf),
it consulted expert HIV researchers to estimate a likelihood that vaccine
development would be both successful and not preempted by substitutes. The cost
of vaccine development was estimated based on the costs and frequency of past
partially successful vaccine candidates. They then found very large benefits
relative to costs from increasing annual R&D spending from $900 million to $1
billion, provided that this increase would accelerate vaccine development by ~5
months (vs a baseline 20-30 year timeframe), so that vaccine research would
outrank deployment of existing treatments in cost-effectiveness.

Reasoning like this, taking into account the magnitude of potential gains in a
field, the scale of inputs so far, track records in similar fields, expert
judgment (with [caveats](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7959.html)) and
interim successes, can make a good start at deciding what research areas to bet
on when trying to steer towards high impact.

Imagine a high school student who sits down to study for exams. Her chemistry
book is lying closest to her on the desk, so she decides to study chemistry.
Her father points out that since she has an A in chemistry and a D in geometry,
studying geometry might help her grades more. “But that book is all the way
over there in my backpack,” the student points out; “I prefer to study
locally.”

If you were her parent, you probably wouldn't let her get away with this. All
things being equal, she would benefit most from studying the subjects where she
is most behind. Even though she hasn't learned all the chemistry there is to
know, a few hours of studying geometry will get her farther than spending the
same hours on chemistry.

Even within rich countries, we don't have straight As on our report card.
Homelessness, environment, prisons, health, schools – we're behind where we
should be in lots of areas.  I've seen many of these first-hand, and I care
passionately about them.

But these are not our worst subjects. The fact that millions of people every
year die of easily preventable diseases, and billions live in grinding poverty
– that is a much worse failure. Only it's not happening right here next to us;
it's happening far away.

The good news is this: the same amount of effort goes a lot farther on our
worst subjects.  For a few hundred dollars, I can save a life somewhere in the
developing world. There’s no local charity (local to me in the United States)
where that money will accomplish anywhere near as much.

I'm not saying we should neglect local causes altogether. If our own society
falls apart, we’ll be less able to help. But we should put most of our effort –
and money – toward areas where we’re failing.

Most people I've talked to, if asked whether helping more people is better than helping less, have given me a kindly look reserved for a particularly slow sort of person. "Of course!", they've said. "Who would save one child when they could save dozens for the same amount?"

At least that's what they've said.

Does this mean that people sincerely want a heart attack? Hardly. It just means humans are motivated by many things, and reason is but one of them.

However, your conclusion is quite dangerous – it might be even morally wrong in some instances. The dangerous thing is that you suggest that it is better to be average in all domains (chemistry and geometry) rather than exceptional in one domain (chemistry). If the student is a second Marie Curie, it might be the wrong choice to make her learn geometry (that is, that she has sufficient skill in geometry to be allowed to continue to study chemistry).

Applied to charities and the like, my argument would state that it might be morally wrong to donate to charities that are more cost-effective now because other charities might use the money to develop solutions that are much more-cost effective in the future.

My point is, that development matters, and it is not sufficient to look at the now and conclude that it is always best to spend the money on what seems to grant the best benefit in the current situation – although I must admit, that it is nearly always the best option (but nearly always is nearly always!).

We are not based around the single idea that one should pursue a higher-earning career in order to donate the proceeds to charity - much less that bankers are inherently the most ethical career path. 

Rather, <i>we wish to reflect seriously and in clear-headed fashion upon the impact our careers can have, and adjust our life plans accordingly</i>. This means looking into the tremendous power our earnings have, but our impact is by no means limited to them. For example, you can have a very high impact through campaigning or policy-making. 

One of the highest-impact ethical people of the twentieth century was a man you have probably never heard of - [Viktor Zhdanov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Zhdanov), Deputy Minister of Health for the Soviet Union. In 1958, he called for a programme to eradicate smallpox at the World Health Assembly and then lobbied for its acceptance, which came the following year. In 1977, the WHO declared smallpox the first infectious disease ever eradicated by humanity.

Another integral figure was [Donald Henderson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Henderson), the head of the smallpox unit at the Center for Disease Control in the US, and the advisor who convinced President Johnson to fund the WHO eradication programme rather than other, less targeted health initiatives. The US became the single biggest donor to the programme, and Henderson himself went on to become its director in the 1960s.

To get a sense of scale on this, you have to realize that more people died of smallpox in the 20th century than died of war, genocide, murder, and political famines (like the collectivization famines in China and the Ukraine, which killed tens of millions of people) <i>combined</i>. It is estimated to have killed between 300 and 500 million people in the 20th century - and that’s before it was eradicated three quarters of the way through. Its eradication was arguably more iconic and historically significant than the moon landing.

It is clear, however, that the examples of Misters Zhdanov and Henderson should serve as an example, not a model - their contribution was unique, and unlikely to be repeated in our lifetime. Still, it does demonstrate that being in the right position - which might end up being a mid-to-high-level bureaucrat, as Zhdanov and Henderson were - can prove pivotal. 

To take a more recent example, in 2010, the UK Department for International Development awarded the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative - [Giving What We Can’s](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org) top recommended charity for cost-effectiveness - a grant of £25 million. Bearing in mind that funding for research into neglected tropical diseases (such as schistosomiasis) has been on a universally downward trend since the recession, this is no small achievement. Having been involved in the decision to fund SCI, and using that to increase that funding by only a couple of percentage points, would be an extremely high-impact contribution.

And it is this kind of example that 80,000 Hours seeks to encourage. There are a variety of ways to have a tremendous impact through your career, often within the field you feel most passionately about. ]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier></dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2012-01-18 13:50:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status></item><item><title>Biases in career choice: Don't be misled by the category 'high impact career' when deciding between careers</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/55-biases-in-career-choice-don-t-be-misled-by-the-category-high-impact-career-when-deciding-between-careers</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[I've noticed a bias in my thinking about career options that I'd like to help you avoid: I often group several careers together into a ‘high impact’ category even when the careers are very different in their potential to make an impact. 

For instance, I’ve been considering different professional philanthropy careers. I've noticed that I tend to think of professional philanthropy through being employed as a programmer and through going into finance as similarly high impact, even though bankers can earn several times the salary of programmers and thus donate more to charity.

Similar thinking may occur in conventional ethical careers advice. Jobs working in a charity tend to be thought of as ‘ethical’, even though some charities have [many times the impact of others](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/resources/recommended-charities.php). Similarly, some jobs within a charity are [much less replaceable](http://80000hours.org/blog/18-just-what-is-making-a-difference-counterfactuals-and-career-choice) than others and so have a higher impact.


### Why do we think in this way?

1[].  The flaw in my thinking seems to be an example of the cognitive bias _scope neglect_, which is a result of the human tendency to think in categories. In a psychology experiment, three groups of people were asked how much they'd be willing to pay for nets to save 2000, 20,000 or 200,000 birds from drowning in uncovered oil pools. Their answers were surprisingly similar: $80, $78, and $88 respectively.(1) The proposed explanation is that when the people in the experiment were weighing up how much they were willing to give to save the birds, they imagined a prototype event (a suffering, drowning bird) and weighed up how bad it was, regardless of how many birds were actually drowning.(2) 

In a similar way, when thinking about careers you probably have the categories 'high-earning', 'influential', and ‘ethical’ in your mind represented by prototype cases, even though careers in those categories differ a great deal in earnings, influence, and how much difference they make. 

2[]. Another reason for my flawed thinking is that humans tend to think in terms of diminishing returns(3) and this can affect the way we decide between high-earning careers. The subjective value of gaining £100 is less than two times the subjective value of gaining £50. So we perceive the difference between earning £120,000 per year and £70,000 per year as much less than the difference between earning £20,000 and £70,000 per year. Indeed, we'd be tempted to regard both the job that pays £120,000 per year and £70,000 per year as 'high earning.'

This thinking would be useful if you were going to spend the money on yourself because after a certain point the extra money won't make much difference to your happiness. But when you're donating to charity, giving twice as much money really is twice as good. Even if you've already saved 50 lives, saving an additional 50 is just as valuable.(4)

### How to avoid this bias when thinking about careers

To avoid these biases, try to think of different careers as having different levels of impact and compare all the options rather than settling for one that minimally satisfies your idea of a high impact career. 

One way of comparing your options is to use rough numbers to measure the potential impact of each career. Your comparison might show you that some are many times better than others. Coming up with a measure of impact is tricky, but there’s often something available. A campaigner, for instance, could think about how many extra people they are able to reach. You can also use money to estimate impact. Someone working as a manager in an NGO could think about the size of the budget they control. A philanthropist could think about how much money they can donate.

Another way to decide from among a set of careers is to imagine yourself in the most high-impact career of the set. Then decide whether you'd be willing to reduce the amount of good you do to pursue a career with less impact. For example, would you be ok with saving 100 fewer lives per year if you took a lower-impact job?

You do eventually get diminishing returns to charitable donations when the most cost-effective interventions receive all the donations they need and you have to donate to the next most cost-effective intervention. However, the benefits to other people diminish much slower than they would if you spent the money on yourself.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>7</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2012-07-11 14:33:06</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>403</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Ben Hoskin</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>ben.j.hoskin@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-07-12 19:49:30</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA["The subjective value of gaining £100 is less than two times the subjective value of gaining £50.

Possibly one other reason why people underestimate how much difference their path can make is the intuition that "if it seems too good to be true, it probably is." In semi-efficient markets, you're not going to easily find an investment that has 3 times the expected returns of the standard investments that most people choose. So people may doubt whether you can really get a job that pays 3 times as much as other "high earning" jobs without too much difference in working hours and the required intelligence/skill level. I think empirical realities militate against this assumption somewhat for careers, although the intuition is still something to keep in mind.

Similar thinking may apply to differential charity cost-effectiveness, but here the "efficient market" intuition is even less strong, both because people don't optimize charity as much as they do their income and because different people have different values, so what's optimal for one person may be wastefully ineffective for another.

One final consideration is that some people (including me somewhat) are psychologically overwhelmed by demanding of themselves that they do the most they possibly can. In order to stay sane, we mere mortals sometimes have to make compromises. "Don't let the best be the enemy of the good," etc. Of course, if the best is many times better than the good, then it can be worth taking a chance to achieve the best even at the risk of losing the good.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>407</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Richard Batty</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>rjlbatty@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/richard-batty</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-07-16 12:43:27</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for that Ben, I've changed the post so that it only implies a sub-linear relationship.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>408</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Ben</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>ben.j.hoskin@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-07-17 19:10:43</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Cool!]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Why Do People Love Charity Workers? pt 2</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/58-why-do-people-love-charity-workers-pt-2</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the last post, I argued that self-sacrifice is not, on its own, relevant to the moral value of an act. But if that’s the case, then why (again) do people love charity workers just because their work involves greater self-sacrifice? 

I would suggest that this mistake is a symptom of a broader conceptual confusion between two questions:

* Q1: What ought we to do?
* Q2: What kinds of motives would a good person have?

Q1 is about acts and what’s morally right. Q2 asks about agents and their character. Depending on your moral views, the answers to these questions may diverge. 

Self-sacrifice doesn't seem directly relevant to Q1. But the willingness to carry some great burden might be a good motive: If everyone had that kind of character, then the world would probably be a better place. So, it may be relevant to Q2. 

You might still find something fishy about the idea that the self-sacrifice of a charity worker doesn't make charity work ethically preferable. If so, I think your thought might really be that **charity work is *praiseworthy* ** because it reflects good character or motives. But that wouldn't imply that you ought to do charity work even when funding it instead would be more effective. 

Let me explain. Praise and blame are ways of reacting to each other's behavior, and they don't correspond perfectly to right acts and wrong acts. People who act wrongly are not always blameworthy, since they may have a good excuse. Young children sometimes act wrongly but aren't blameworthy because (say) they don't know any better. And **people who act rightly are not always praiseworthy**, since they may not have done enough good or done it intentionally. So, praiseworthiness/blameworthiness and rightness/wrongness often come apart. 

We might drive an even greater wedge between these concepts. On [one](http://www.philosophyetc.net/2009/05/evaluating-character.html) [influential](http://www.philosophyetc.net/2011/12/scalar-consequentialism-and-constructed.html) [account](http://www.philosophyetc.net/2012/04/singers-pond-and-quality-of-will.html), we are blameworthy when our acts display insufficient good will, and we are praiseworthy when our acts show great concern for others. Charity workers may be praiseworthy because their self-sacrifice shows such high **quality of will**. While this evaluation bears on Q2 (the assessment of agents), it may not bear on Q1 (the assessment of acts). If our answers to Q1 are about the consequences of our acts and whether our choices make a difference in the lives of people in need, then good will and self-sacrifice may be irrelevant to what we ought to do. 

People might be particularly prone to this confusion in the context of **career choice**. If we spend over 80,000 hours on a job, then people may tend to evaluate career choice not as an act or decision, but rather as a matter of *character*. But choosing a career -- by seeking information, applying for jobs, and accepting offers -- is an action (or set of actions), and effective altruists want to know what they ought to *choose* to make the most difference. Self-sacrifice is not directly relevant to this question. 

So, why does this point matter? If this is right, then one important aspect of the common affinity for charity workers stems from a conflation of distinct moral concepts. Self-sacrifice may be relevant to our character and the quality of our will, but to the extent that making a difference is important, altruism may diverge from self-sacrifice in the context of career choice. ]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>:</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2012-07-21 10:55:31</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>421</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Richard Batty</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>rjlbatty@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/richard-batty</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-07-21 11:40:58</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is a really useful distinction.

It seems reasonable to follow 'conventional wisdom'. So even though conventional wisdom on charity is mistaken, I don't think the average person going off to work for a charity because conventional wisdom says that's really ethical is at much epistemic fault. And if they aren't at epistemic fault, I don't think they're guilty of being uncaring or reckless: they're trying to do the good based on their reasonable beliefs, and that seems praiseworthy even if they're beliefs happen to be mistaken.

(That said, there might be a case certain things are just irrational *even if* they are conventional wisdom: maybe for example one just should do a lot of research about how one should spent one's career, and - even though it is conventional - those who do not do so are just irrational. But I find it hard to see how particular views on the empirical questions re. charity effectiveness would be unreasonable to hold *even if* it is conventional wisdom: that seems a bit too epistemically demanding; we don't have time to scour all empirical questions ourselves.)]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Following in Schindler's footsteps</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/52-following-in-schindler-s-footsteps</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[Can it be ethical to take a job working for an immoral corporation if one does so with the aim of making the world a better place?

Suppose, for example, that you could work for an arms company, supplying munitions to soldiers fighting an unjust war, in order that you could earn enough money to save thousands of lives? You know that, if you don’t take that job, someone else more ruthless than you will take it, hurting more people than you would. 

Is that sufficient? Intuitively, it seems that it just can’t be ethical to do this. But a historical case suggests otherwise.

The example I’m thinking of is that of Oskar Schindler, who was immortalized through the novel Schindler’s Ark and the film Schindler’s List. Schindler ran munitions factories for the Nazis, producing mess kits and, later, ammunition for Nazi soldiers. He did this so that he could earn enough money to literally buy the lives of 1200 Jews. 

A key aspect of the story is that he deliberately ran his factories less efficiently than whoever would have been in his place. Though accounts of Schindler have questioned his character - he was an opportunist and a womanizer - his decision to run the Nazi factories in order to save his workers has been universally admired.(1) In particular, we think that Schindler should have acted as he did even if he had had the option to escape, avoiding having to work for the Nazis, but saving a much smaller number of Jews. 

As well as the sheer size of the benefit he was able to give others, two salient reasons why we think it admirable that he acted as he did are that he did not intend any of the harm that he caused - in fact he acted with the best of intentions - and that he in fact managed to better the lives of many people by running his factories less efficiently than the person who would have been in his shoes. 

As regards career choice, we often think that working for an immoral organization is itself immoral. The example of Schindler shows this not necessarily to be the case. In general, if you have the view that pursuing professional philanthropy by working for an immoral corporation is unethical, then you have at the same time to be able to explain why Schindler acted commendably. It seems to me that this is pretty difficult to do. 

***

(1) A casual survey of the many tribute websites reveals rhapsodic praise for Schindler. See, for example, Louis Bülow, [Oskar Schindler: His list of life](http://www.oskarschindler.com), 2011, who claims: 'Oscar Schindler rose to the highest level of humanity, walked through the bloody mud of the Holocaust without soiling his soul, his compassion, his respect for human life.' Even David M. Crowe’s biography, Oskar Schindler: The Untold Account of His Life, Wartime Activites, and the True Story Behind the List (Basic Books, 2007), which takes a particularly dispassionate and unromantic view of Schindler, describes him as 'one of the most remarkable Righteous Gentiles in the Holocaust' (p.624).

One important part of this is making decisions about what to do with money. This matters for anyone with more money than they feel they need for themselves and those close to them; and it matters especially for people who plan to do good by earning a lot and giving a lot away. I think it's fair to say that, so far, this site has generally answered this question by focusing on the good that can be done by giving to well-functioning charities. There is a lot to be said for this. The questions, though, seem wider to me. I'll try to explain here why I think so.

One principle of this site is that it is important to think of the consequences of one's acts, including acts of giving, rather than just the act itself. Thinking about these consequences should not stop at the fact that some individuals' lives have been changed by your giving. There are questions about the effects of the gift, and its immediate results, on complex social and economic systems. There are also questions about what the consequences would have been of the other things you could have done with the money.

All of this is, of course, terribly complex. You cannot come close to the sort of confidence that you can have about the more direct consequences of, say, a health intervention, or many other concrete projects that charitable giving can support. Perhaps, in the end, you will decide that the uncertainties about broader consequences are so great that you should focus only on the immediate, more or less measurable good that you can do. But the wider questions are worth thinking about, and I don't think people should despair at learning things that might guide their decisions until those questions have been struggled with.

As an example, could it end up doing more good to invest money in assets in poor countries, or to buy products you like from companies that source materials or labour from poor countries, than to give it to a charity that works in those countries? Could spending at home, in a rich country, succeed in increasing wealth there in ways that bring good to poorer countries that can export to them? For all their limitations, markets are powerful structures for generating efficiency and channelling resources to where they can be most productive. Could money that works through markets rather than gifts be more effective in bringing positive economic changes in poorer countries, and perhaps thus the welfare, political and social goods that are supported by increased economic productivity?

I don't know. It seems to me that it might be worth listening to what economists have to say about these questions, with due scepticism about the limits of economic modelling but also respect for the attempt to trace the systematic consequences of certain decisions through complex structures involving millions of agents. Does anyone know of academics engaged with this particular question – the welfare consequences of giving money as compared to investing or spending it? Or the welfare consequences of how and where one invests or spends it? In any case, I don't feel comfortable giving money before I have a better understanding of how to make that comparison.

There are other concerns which bring up similarly complex questions, for example about the political and social consequences of foreign-funded charities and aid organizations taking on the provision of certain services. Often, these sorts of concerns just act to forestall making any decision at all, or to give cover for carrying on living without concern for others. But this is all the more reason for people who really do want to find the answers to engage with them.
 
If people who are ready to live in line with their best understanding of what would do the most good, but perplexed at what that might be, take on those questions, knowing that some decision is called for and impatient to find the answers, perhaps things might become a little clearer. When you have the explicit aim of making a decision in the light of what you learn, the questions become sharper, and the uncertainties become perhaps more tolerable – when a decision is unavoidable, discoveries that nudge you in one direction are precious even if you remain finally unsure. A community exchanging ideas can perhaps help individual questioning aggregate into some body of ideas rather than remaining fragmented and personal, although there will surely be many disagreements. I hope a place can be found here for these sorts of questions.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>;</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2012-07-22 20:29:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>435</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Ben Gilbert</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>captainitaly@hotmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/ben-gilbert</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-07-23 12:56:43</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Jeff- I think that this question turns mainly on whether saving lives - interventions that lower mortality - will lead to lower fertility. Since the 19th century, countries across the world have seen a pattern of fertility starting to fall a few decades after infant mortality began to fall. The fall in fertility generally outweighed the fall in mortality, so population growth has slowed down or reversed.

Most African nations seem to be following this pattern - there is a strong correlation between infant mortality and fertility across African nations (though by itself this does not prove causation). So, there is good reason to think that saving lives will actually reduce population growth in the medium term. The next decade or two should show whether this is right, since there have recently been large falls in child mortality across most of Africa. ([http://www.economist.com/node/21555571](http://www.economist.com/node/21555571))

It might be the case that fertility will fall in Africa, due to better health, but still remain higher than in other regions, for reasons particular to Africa. This could create problems (though not necessarily - there is an argument that Africa is underpopulated!) But, even if so, saving lives will have made the problems less severe than they would have been otherwise.

If, on the other hand, reducing mortality will not have an effect, or enough of an effect, on fertility, then this argument will not apply.

Instead of focusing on what you do directly, ask yourself *what would have happened if I hadn’t been there?*

The real *difference* we make is the difference between what happened because of us, and and what would have happened otherwise.

Thinking about impact explicitly like that opens up lots of new ways to make the world a better place.

Let’s explore some examples:

&nbsp;

1) **Fundraising**

<br>

<center><a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/25/original/chugger.jpg?1348486710'><img alt="Chugger" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/25/large/chugger.jpg?1348486710"/></a></center>

<br>

A charity runs a huge campaign raising money for medicine to prevent deaths due to HIV/AIDs, and raise millions of pounds.

*What was their direct impact?*

Directly, the fundraisers caused a large number of donations to their cause. This money is used to save many lives in the developing world.

*What would have happened if they hadn’t run the campaign?*

Some of the donors would have given less money to charity over the rest of the year. But other donors have only changed their donations. If the campaign hadn’t been run, these donors [would have given](http://80000hours.org/blog/92-why-don-t-charities-spend-more-on-fundraising) some of the money to different charities instead.

*What was their true impact?*

If these other charities [needed the money more](http://80000hours.org/blog/93-why-most-charity-fundraisers-cause-harm), then the campaign might have even been harmful. At any rate, the fundraising didn’t do as much good as it first looks. To do more good as a fundraiser, you have to increase the total amount given to charity, and be wary of pulling funds away from other important causes.

&nbsp;

2) **The high impact secretary**

<br>

<center><a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/33/original/Stivers-7-30-05-personal-as.gif?1348751672'><img alt="Stivers-7-30-05-personal-as" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/33/medium/Stivers-7-30-05-personal-as.gif?1348751672" /></a></center>

<br>

Sarah runs one of the main research teams aiming to develop vaccines to end malaria. Everyone agrees that under Sarah’s leadership, the team has been enormously successful, bringing the development of the vaccine forward by several years and perhaps saving [several million lives](http://80000hours.org/blog/5-high-impact-science). Sarah, however, would not have been nearly as successful without her secretary, Dave. Dave has great judgement, and is the best secretary she’s ever found. He saves her lots of stress and time. This lets Sarah spend much more time and effort doing and overseeing the research.

*What was Dave’s direct impact?*

Directly, Dave’s just doing secretarial work. Not particularly high impact, right?

*What would have happened if Dave wasn’t Sarah’s secretary?*

Sarah would have found a different secretary, who would have probably been much less helpful than Dave.

*What was Dave’s true impact?*

If Dave saves Sarah an extra hour per day, which she spends [pushing the research effort forward faster](http://80000hours.org/blog/54-the-high-impact-pa-how-anyone-can-bring-about-ground-breaking-research), then he might easily have sped up the research effort by 10%. That could mean preventing thousands of deaths due to malaria. Give him some credit.

&nbsp;

3) **Becoming a doctor**

<br>

<center><a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/12/original/doctor.jpg?1345407549'><img alt="Doctor" class="image medium" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/12/medium/doctor.jpg?1345407549" /></a> </center>

<br>

Chris works in the emergency room and sees hundreds of patients per year, many of which are in critical condition.

*What was Chris’s direct impact?*

Directly, Chris saves tens or hundreds of lives per year.

*What would have happened if he hadn’t taken the job?*

This is a critical function of the health system, so if Chris hadn’t taken the job, it would have been allocated to another doctor who is currently doing something much less important. Ultimately another doctor would have probably been hired.

*What was Chris’s true impact?*

The loss to the health system if Chris hadn’t become a doctor would be having to hire someone less skilled doing a much less important task. So by becoming a doctor, he’s saving far fewer lives than it looks. We’ve estimated that by becoming an average doctor in the UK, you allow people to live an extra 600 years of healthy life, which is roughly like [saving one life every three years](http://80000hours.org/blog/72-how-many-lives-does-a-doctor-save).

&nbsp;

4) **The ethical rice trader**

<br>

<center><a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/53/original/PF-trader-1_1444353c.jpg?1351553958'><img alt="Pf-trader-1_1444353c" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/53/large/PF-trader-1_1444353c.jpg?1351553958" /></a></center>

<br>

Tish trades rice futures, pretty evil right? Excessive speculation in agricultural commodities could [increase volatility](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=42412&Cr=Food&Cr1=FAO#.UGhuglE0jSg), making life harder for developing world farmers.

*What was her direct impact?*

Directly, Tish is taking part in an industry that might harm the global poor.

*What would have happened if she hadn’t taken the job?*

Tish cares deeply about making the world a better place, so she avoids the types of trades that drive up volatility (trend following). If she hadn’t taken the job, odds are someone less scrupulous would have taken the job instead, and the market would have become more volatile. In addition, Tish donates a big fraction of her income to charities helping those in the developing world. Since she donates much more than the average rice trader, if she hadn’t taken the job, these donations wouldn’t have happened otherwise.

*What was her true impact?*

Despite participating in a potentially [harmful industry](http://80000hours.org/blog/35-the-replaceability-effect-working-in-unethical-industries-part-1), Tish has a positive impact by making it less harmful than it would have been without her.

&nbsp;



5) **The beautiful researcher**

<br>

<center><a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/54/original/geek_chic.jpg?1351553961'><img alt="Geek_chic" class="image medium" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/54/medium/geek_chic.jpg?1351553961" /></a></center>

<br>

Sam narrowly gets a job at the World Bank allocating aid money, in part due to his good looks.

*What’s his direct impact?*

Sam goes on to do lots of great work, which makes the world better for millions of people.

*What would have happened if he hadn’t taken the job?*
His [good looks](http://80000hours.org/blog/89-why-attractive-people-are-dangerous) swung the interview for him. But they don’t exactly help him in the job. If he hadn’t taken the job, it would have gone to someone who would have done it slightly better.

*What was his true impact?*

The job affects millions of people, so if it was done a little better, it could mean thousands of extra people would be helped. His [true impact](http://80000hours.org/blog/89-why-attractive-people-are-dangerous) was to make thousands of people worse off.

&nbsp;

Your true impact can be completely different from the impact you appear to have directly. Unfortunately, we usually give credit to direct impact in careers, and ignore what would have happened otherwise. And so, millions of people end up making less difference than they could have.

To get some ideas for careers with a large true impact, have a look at our [rules of thumb](/rules-of-thumb) for finding good opportunities, and check out some of our [best](/causes) [ideas](/types-of-career).

<center><a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/33/original/Stivers-7-30-05-personal-as.gif?1348751672'><img alt="Stivers-7-30-05-personal-as" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/33/medium/Stivers-7-30-05-personal-as.gif?1348751672" /></a></center>

Suppose you could identify a really important research topic - one that could yield huge benefits to millions of people … something like ending ageing, developing a cheap, clean supply of energy, or discovering a cheap vaccine for HIV/AIDs. Suppose you think that carrying out this research is one of the most important things for humanity to do.

At this point, it’s easy to think ‘how can I get involved with this field?’ If you can get the right qualifications, you could aim to become a researcher in this field, with visions of being the person who makes the crucial breakthrough.

But now ask yourself: ‘is the important thing that _I_ do this research, or is the important thing that _someone_ does it?’ If what you really care about is helping others - making a difference - and not personal glory, then it’s the latter rather than the former that’s important. This shift in perspective opens up some unusual ethical career options.

Rather than attempt to personally become a researcher in that field, instead attempt to find the very best researcher already working on the issue. If you can do that, then it’s in your power to bring about more of the very best research in the world. 

Consider: if you can save that researcher one hour spent on activities besides research, then that researcher can spend one more hour researching. So, by saving that researcher time, you can convert your time into their time. Suddenly, one of your hours becomes one more hour spent by the best researcher, working in the best field!

Since the most effective researchers can achieve [extraordinary amounts](http://80000hours.org/blog/5-high-impact-science), you too could have an extraordinary impact.

There are many ways you could do this. For instance, you could volunteer to become their PA (Personal Assistant) - something many top academics lack. Then you could save them time spent organising meetings, shopping, filing taxes etc. If you picked the right person, then at least some of this would result in more research.

<br>

<center><a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/32/original/secretary.jpg?1348673926'><img alt="Secretary" class="image medium" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/32/medium/secretary.jpg?1348673926" /></a></center>

<br>

At certain universities, researchers are required to teach undergraduates. Sometimes this indirectly makes the researcher better at research - they gain from the challenge of explaining their field. But in other cases it detracts from the amount of time spent on research. If you were an academic in the same field, you could volunteer to take the best researcher’s teaching load. 

Even if qualified, if you pursue research directly, it’s very unlikely that you’ll end up as the best researcher in the best field. It will also take you several decades to attain that kind of position. In many cases, each year’s delay means thousands of deaths. So, by becoming a PA you could actually have far more impact than you could by pursuing the intuitively ethical course of becoming a researcher in a high impact field.

This option – a type of [improver career](/improver) - doesn’t just apply to research. If you could save the time of any ultra high impact person, you can convert your time into very high impact time.

The cost, of course, is that society won’t recognize your contribution in the same way. When you sit your grandchildren on your lap and tell them about how you contributed to ending ageing, they might assume that you were the person who had the ground-breaking ideas, the one who sat there, microscope pressed against the eye, and actually made the discoveries. They might not be impressed when you tell them that you actually did tax returns for the person who made the discoveries. The same goes for many indirect ways of doing good.

The lack of admiration given by society on such roles doesn’t change the fact that your efforts will have done a huge amount of good. And in fact, it makes these roles all the more virtuous. You’re going against received wisdom and sacrificing the personal glory you might have gained.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>6</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2012-07-09 22:21:52</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>394</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Andy McKenzie</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>amckenz@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-07-09 23:37:48</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I understand why you want to make a counterintuitive point and agree with your assessment that PA's, especially if they're doing a job nobody else would have, can be very valuable.

In practice it’s surely going to be a worse ratio than that – they have to spend some amount of time telling you what they want etc. Also they might also want the time you spend ‘helping’ them as punctuation between serious bouts of research – or they might have reached or neared a saturation point with their work, so that extra free time won’t necessarily go into it. Plus if the planning fallacy makes you overestimate the amount you can help them so that they can’t rely on you you might actually hinder them in some cases. And where there are researchers who’d be worth doing this for and EAs who’d be suitable to do it for them, there’s an opportunity cost in finding them and setting yourself up to help them out.

As an anecdote, I effectively made this offer to you and a couple of other Oxford EAs for the duration of final exams, arguably one of the busiest periods of your life – for whatever reason no-one asked me to do even a single task. Whether that was because you didn’t think I could help much with anything, or you simply hadn’t internalised the idea that someone might actually do stuff for you, the same practical impediment/cognitive bias might affect anyone else you made a similar offer to.

None of this is to say it’s not a possibility worth looking at, but I think we should avoid (both here and in general) making big claims about the effectiveness of untested strategies, especially when they might have been quietly tested and rejected without anyone really mentioning it.

One other thought – there’s no shortage of people willing to do paid PA work, so if you can earn more per hour than a decent PA would, you’d presumably do better to do so and hire a PA. Then that raises the question of whether hiring PAs for people who haven’t done so themselves is better value than donating the money elsewhere.

The main criticism seems to be that it would be difficult to determine whether you should try to become the PA or become the researcher. It's true that it would be difficult, but it's worth noting that these kinds of judgements are made all the time. Whenever we run a phd application process or award grant funding, people are judging which of two applicants are more likely to produce good research. You could do a similar process if you were deciding between these two options.

A second related criticism is that it might be harmful to spread this idea, because it risks discouraging people from research who might be able to do a great deal of good some time in the future. The example might have this effect on some people, but I think many people find the idea that they can do this much good inspiring. Also note that overall 80k encourages people to take seriously even small probabilities that they become a high impact researcher. See this idea in action when applied to entrepreneurship in one of Carl's posts: http://80000hours.org/blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/56/original/1nnGkE_animalwall_preview.jpg?1352046290'><img alt="dog_fence" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/56/large/1nnGkE_animalwall_preview.jpg?1352046290" /></a>

<br> 

There’s an easy way to tell a smart dog from a stupid dog. 

There’s a fence in front of you, and behind it is a delicious juicy bone. You’re starting to salivate just thinking about how amazing it will feel between your teeth. Now you have a choice.

If you’re a stupid dog, you’ll run at the fence, stand in front of the bone and start to bark.

If you’re a smart dog, you’ll look along the fence, find the gate, run happily through it and devour your prize.

Humans also have a hard time finding the gate. It’s easy to get preoccupied with the bone. It can look so inviting that you don’t take the time to look around, take things in, and choose the best path. **Often the best path to making a difference is indirect.** It often means getting other people involved.

* Spend an hour persuading other people to donate to an important cause as a fundraiser and you can easily more than you could have given directly (around [£40 on average](http://80000hours.org/blog/48-fundraising-for-charity-a-career-for-effective-altruists)).

* Have you got a great idea for a social enterprise? Chances are, you can find someone else to do it, and probably do it better than you.

* Rather than work directly for your favourite charity or research lab, if you become a high-earner, you could pay for them to take [several extra staff](/earning-to-give) (or one person with much better qualifications than you).

* Instead of hoping you’ll be the best, find the person who is the best within a cause and [help them out](/improving). If you allow them to do more of their work, then you’ve turned your time into the time of [the best person in the cause](http://80000hours.org/blog/54-the-high-impact-pa-how-anyone-can-bring-about-ground-breaking-research/).

* Don’t give directly to charity. Spend the money researching which charity needs the money most. That way you can allow many other people to [spend their donations many times better](/cost-effectiveness-research-and-prioritisation).

These opportunities are easy to take. They let you improve your impact by getting other people involved. More people usually means more impact. This is why one of our [rules of thumb](/rules-of-thumb) for increasing your impact is to **look for indirect paths**.

But if these opportunities make a big difference and are easy to take, why do they get left lying around? Why are we so bad at finding the gate?

&nbsp;

1) **The best path isn’t obvious**

The most visible solutions tend to be the direct ones. If you want to make a difference, it’s usually because you have a specific group of people you care about. So the first thing that comes to mind is how you personally could make their lives better. Funding other people to work at a non-profit is harder to visualise. It’s off to the side. It’s almost never suggested by careers advisors.

This could be because direct solutions are simpler, involving a shorter chain of events. They put you at the center of the story. That means they’re easier to notice.

An interesting finding in human psychology is that we tend to think more highly of solutions that come to mind easily. Similarly, when the consequences of an action come to mind easily, we tend to think the consequences are bigger. So we’re going to favour obvious actions with obvious, direct consequences. This is called the [availability bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic).

&nbsp;

2) **You have to think ahead**

Indirect solutions sometimes have steps that don’t look like they take you to your goal. This makes things confusing and perhaps difficult to work out in the first place.

One example is the common belief that it’s bad for charities to spend lots of money fundraising.[^1] [This Guardian article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2005/oct/21/voluntarysector.charitablegiving) even suggests that if you give £1 to a charity with a funding ratio of 20%, then “roughly 20p would go towards raising the pound in the first place.” That’s pretty dodgy. If you give the £1 because you believe in the charity, but not because you were swayed by their fundraising, then they didn’t spend any of that £1 on raising your pound in the first place. Rather, they go on to spend 20p of your money raising even more money, probably about [80p of it](http://80000hours.org/blog/48-fundraising-for-charity-a-career-for-effective-altruists).[^2] So, by spending money on fundraising, they’ve almost doubled your donation. In general, if your charity is promoting a good cause, then you should hope they do as much (profitable) fundraising as they possibly can!

Here, the chain of events just is a bit tricky to penetrate. The first steps look counter-intuitive, but turn out to get you where you want to go.

&nbsp;
3) **You might not get the glory**

We tend to give credit to the people who do things directly. We’ve seen a few examples of this changing, like the recent meme comparing [Bill Gates to Batman](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1665854/infographic-of-the-day-bill-gates-is-a-better-superhero-than-batman). But the only reason this seemed novel is that we’d normally give more credit to the superhero who saves millions of people directly than someone who does it indirectly through philanthropy.

When someone makes a big achievement, like a scientist making a huge discovery, we rarely give the other people who made it possible nearly as much credit as they deserve. Some indirect actors are completely forgotten. The credit for overseeing the eradication of small pox usually goes to D. A. Henderson. He directly ran the elimination program. But he would have been replaced by the WHO if he hadn’t taken the job. [Viktor Zhdanov](http://80000hours.org/blog/27-in-praise-of-viktor-zhdanov), however, is usually forgotten. But he’s the person who lobbied the WHO to set the eradication process in action and caused Henderson’s position to be created. He didn’t even have a wikipedia page until 2010. 

This makes a bit of sense. After all, the more indirect the causal chain is, the easier it is for someone who doesn’t really deserve the credit to pretend they do. But sometimes, when the causal chains are clear enough, we really ought to recognise indirect actions.

Most people want credit for their do-gooding, so they are less inclined to take indirect methods. If you care more about making the world a better place than getting credit, then there’s lots of extra great opportunities for you to take.

&nbsp;

4) **Indirect methods seem less moral**

We often [confuse what’s right with what’s praiseworthy](http://80000hours.org/blog/58-why-do-people-love-charity-workers-pt-2), and what’s praiseworthy is strongly linked to what we give credit for. So since people get less credit for indirect actions, this can cause us to think those actions were less morally worthy. 

There just seems to be something especially morally impressive about being a nurse or an aid worker. This isn’t matched by someone who, for instance, donates enough money to allow one extra person to be an aid worker, even if they have the same impact.

It’s easier to do something if it’s widely regarded as the moral thing to do. But if you’re primarily concerned with helping people, rather than with being seen as a moral person, then go for indirect methods.

&nbsp;

5) **You don’t get to do it yourself**

In some sense, it doesn’t matter who does the charity, so long as the world is a better place afterwards. But people don’t actually act like that. Studies suggest that we get a greater feeling of accomplishment when our impact is more tangible and concrete.[^3]

Studies of charitable giving also show that we’re much more motivated to give when our donations have a tangible, concrete impact on other people.[^3] It seems likely that this applies to other ways of doing good. If the outcome is less tangible, then fewer people will be motivated to give. This will mean that opportunities to do a lot of good indirectly will get left lying around.


&nbsp;

In the rest of your life, directness is a virtue. But if you want to make a big difference, 
you have to think indirectly. You have to find the gate.

This is pretty similar to conventional advice on choosing a degree. But I found a lack of practical step-by-step guides to picking the right degree for you. This guide gives you a structured way to gather all the relevant information and to make a decision on your degree. Without a structured process it’s easy to narrow down your options too fast, to ignore important evidence, and to apply your evidence inconsistently. 
<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/80/original/simple_steps.jpg?1358360359'><img alt="Simple_steps" class="image large" align="center" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/80/large/simple_steps.jpg?1358360359" /></a> 

The steps you take depend on how sure you already are about what you want to do. I’ve broken down a sensible set of steps that you might use in the UK. You should feel in control of your choice. With the power of the internet and email you can find the best information and advice once you know where to look and shake off your shyness. This decision is important for you and you shouldn’t hesitate in imposing on people in order to get the information you need. It will also teach you some skills that are useful for many activities that are important for making a difference.

1- Take a prospectus from a major university you might apply to. Large universities offer broadly similar sets of courses, so you don’t really have to do this separately for each university. At this point don’t worry too much about which university to apply to, that can come later. It is, however, probably worth applying to at least one university that’s a level higher than most people think you can get into.

2- Make a list of all the courses they offer. Cross out all the ones you know you don’t care about. If there are any where you’re not sure what they involve, read the page in the prospectus about the course. This step shouldn’t take more than a couple hours tops, but it will depend on how much stuff you’re interested in and on how much extra information you need to get. Even though it will take a bit of work, it’s one of the most useful steps you can take. It makes sure you didn’t rule anything out too quickly.

3- Go through your list again and cross out the courses you definitely aren’t qualified for. To get information on this, look at the prospectus. It should have a table of the subjects at A-level that are recommended for the courses. In some cases this is fairly simple - you can’t study mathematics at university if you haven’t done maths at A level. In other cases this is a bit harder. At this stage, be generous to yourself. But put a mark next to all the courses you are not sure you’re qualified for.

4- For every choice, think about why it is on the list. What is it about the course that interests you? Do you already do some things that indicate an interest? For example, do you read around the subject in your spare time? If you do, do you actually enjoy it or do you do it because you felt you ought to? If you don’t, why don’t you? Is it because you like the idea of being interested in the subject but you aren’t actually interested? Or is it just because it never really occurred to you? Do you think you could motivate yourself start reading around it? If not, you might not get that much out of a degree in the subject. 

These are just some considerations. You don’t really need to be passionate about your degree when you just get started. Most people haven’t already learned their subject before they go to university. That’s why they’re going to university! But if you are passionate about one thing, that’s a strong vote in its favour. If you aren’t, that’s more than ok. Often it isn’t until you really start working at something that you get interested in it. How passionate you end up being can depend whether you have a clear purpose for your studies. It might also be shaped by the style of the learning.

Important: do this for everything left on your list. Don’t close off your thoughts too soon. And be generous. You might not be thinking about studying, for example, chemistry. But when you think about it, you do really enjoy classes and you are always a little interested when you see news articles about it. That’s worth noticing about yourself.

5- Now go back to all the items that had a mark against them because you weren’t sure if you were qualified for them. Are you passionate about them? Are you willing to do some extra work to make the stuff you *have* already studied relevant to the course? Could you explain to someone why it is that you didn’t choose the A levels that would have been most helpful? Have your interests changed since you chose them? Have you demonstrated that through actions? 

Universities make recommendations about requirements for a reason. In their experience people who don’t meet the requirements have a hard time. You should tend to follow their advice. *But*, and this is important, if it matters at all to you don’t hesitate for a second in emailing the university admissions department and explaining your situation. This will cost you less than an hour of time and will let you stop worrying about whether or not you’re qualified. If you’re lucky you’ll get the answer you want. If you’re lucky in the other direction, you’ll be able to avoid wasting time and an application choice on a spot you weren’t going to get offered.

6- By now, you should have a short-list of 1-4 possible degrees to study. You’ve narrowed it down to choices you’d probably enjoy - now you want to try to get an outside view on whether or not you’d be good at them. Which subjects that you do at school are relevant to the course - how well do you tend to do at them? Make a note of the sorts of marks you get on relevant tests. If you can, try to work out what percentile you score in standardised tests like GCSE’s or AS. If you’re in the top 10% nationally in something then [that’s worth knowing.](http://80000hours.org/blog/132-how-to-judge-your-chances-of-success)

7- Ask your parents and teachers if they think you would be good at each choice. Listen to what they say, but don’t just accept what they say completely. Parents don’t always have a good picture of what you are capable of at school and they might have a lot of preconceptions. For example, they might always think you’re amazing at everything when less biased evidence disagrees. Or they might not think you’re university material, but only think that because they didn’t go to university and so they don’t really think university is something the family does. Or they might have hated university and assume you would too even though you’re a different person. So you should take their advice into consideration - but don’t just accept it. If your school doesn’t often send students to university, teachers might have a bad picture of what sort of person you have to be in order to go to university. Alternatively, they might not know very much about what it takes to go to university. It’s actually, startlingly, not really their job to advise you on university choices. Even if your school does have a full-time university advisor they can be badly misinformed. I have heard of some who got application deadlines badly wrong, or who gave practice interviews to students that were bizarrely aggressive and unrelated to the subjects being studied just because the advisor though that was how it was done.

8- Ask your friends and look at student forums. This is something you’ll almost inevitably want to do. But you should basically totally ignore what they say. They don’t really know anything about which degrees are good. They don’t really know anything about how to apply to universities. Treat any information you get here with a heap of salt and always refer back to original sources for any information that you’d expect a university to have published, like course requirements or deadlines.

Your friends will know a bit about you, but unless they are way more perceptive than a typical person they probably won’t know you as well as you do. It’s also not particularly important to make your university plans similar to your friends’. My impression is that most people underestimate how easy it will be to make friends at university, and overestimate how long their school relationships will last once they go to university.

9- Ask the universities. These guys are much more trustworthy than your parents and teachers. That’s because they are the only ones who have an incentive to get all the best pupils they can and they don’t have (as many) preconceptions about you. And it’s because they tend to know the contents of their own courses much better. They know much better which parts of the course people struggle with. 

It’s here where most people don’t put in as much work as they should. This is usually because it just doesn’t occur to them, they are shy, or they are lazy. This is actually really easy and it is definitely worth it.

Emailing the admissions department about the qualities that tend to make a successful applicant is ok. But the real gold comes from actually speaking to a professor who teaches the courses. But, you’re saying, you don’t know the professor. Of course you don’t! But it’s not hard to change that.

For example, suppose I want to apply for Physics at Oxford. I google “oxford physics undergraduate professor”. The first hit is the page for undergraduates studying physics at Merton College, Oxford. That might not be a college I want to apply to but that doesn’t matter and might even be a good thing. The page lists a bunch of professors and tutors. Three are listed as “Tutors” rather than “Other Merton academics in Physics” so they are probably more involved in the teaching. They all have links to their profiles and those profiles list their teaching interests. The first two tutors list lots of teaching interests, so they are probably doing more teaching. The third doesn’t list any, so he’s either lazy about filling in the form or doesn’t care much about teaching. Either way, he’s low priority. In the absence of anything else to go by, I’m going to email the first guy. His email address is at the bottom of his profile page.

This doesn’t just work for Physics at Oxford. Trying History at Bristol - “bristol history undergraduate professor”. The first hit is the page for the Department of History at Bristol. That gives you a link for prospective applicants. You can go there too, and quickly find an email address for the admissions department and guidelines on requirements, but we’re going to be sneakier. You click on the link for current students. That takes you to a page which includes the course handbook. The course handbook has, after a quick skim of the table of contents, a section titled “Key Department and School Personnel”. It’s not obvious who the best person to ask here is. I’d be tempted by the Director of Student Progress - that title suggests a good understanding of what holds people back in being successful at the course. But you can take your pick.

If that format doesn’t work for you, you can try other keywords. For example, you can search for a course outline, find the introductory lecture course that 1st year students take and email the lecturer who runs that course.

I’ve demonstrated how easy it is to get the email address of the people who don’t normally get admissions questions. But what’s the point? Surely they’ll just ignore my email or tell me to talk to the admissions department. Well, maybe they will. And if they do you have to respect that and then email the next best person. They might be very busy, or on sabbatical or holiday. They might genuinely just think they aren’t well placed to answer your question. But on the other hand they are often helpful and friendly and interested in helping out.

Keep your emails to them short and to the point. Explain that you are thinking about studying x, and you want to work out how good you would be at it. Ask them what they think are the best predictors of success in undergraduates. Ask them if they have any advice on how to judge if you would get a lot out of the course. Ask them questions you have about the teaching style, but only if you have genuine questions which are not covered by published material. Don’t be overly formal, but be respectful. They are doing you a favour, but you don’t want to make it sound like they’re doing you a *big* favour.

It might be possible to turn that into a really useful and interesting conversation. Or not. Respect the fact that they do have other priorities. You also might have other priorities.

10- Find graduate employment data. A good source for this data is the [HECSU survey on where graduates are 6m after graduation](www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/careers/what-do-graduates-do/). Note down what percentage of graduates get employed in jobs that use the degree’s skills, and the percentage that are unemployed after 6m. Remember that this data is for the whole of the UK and that it doesn’t necessarily apply to you. You’ll want to look at your percentile scores at, e.g., GCSEs to work out where you stand relative to the distribution. (Bearing in mind that 10th percentile at GCSE is not the same as 10th percentile of graduates, because more academically talented people are more likely to graduate.)

Now you have assembled all of your data and need to turn that into a decision. In my next post I’ll outline a framework that will structure your thoughts and help you reach a decision.

* Look over your university's course catalog and try to identify the longest prerequisite chains.  (For example, Chem 1A is necessary for Chem 1B ... [insert 3 more classes here] ... is necessary for Organic Chemistry 2C.)  Most likely the longest prerequisite chains will be found in chemistry, math, and physics.
* Take the first course in each chain that's targeted at people who are actually majoring in that thing.  For example, don't take a "chemistry for biologists" class... most likely, the "chemistry for chemists" class will also work to fulfill the same requirement, and it could also be usefully applied to a chemistry degree.  Similarly, don't bother with non-calculus-based physics (unless it's a required prereq for the calculus-based physics course).
* Use sites like ratemyprofessors.com to try to take your classes with professors who are most excited about their subject and will make you interested in it.

The advantage of this algorithm is that by starting on long prequisite chains *now*, you're giving yourself maximal opportunity to major in something that requires the completion of such a chain.  If you only realized that you needed to complete a long prequisite chain in your junior year, say, then you might have a harder time fitting it in.

There are some good degrees (e.g. economics and computer science) that don't really have long prerequisite chains (though they probably do require calculus), so don't let my advice narrow your approach too much.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Should you go into research? - part 1</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/65-should-you-go-into-research-part-1</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[Should you go into a research career? Here’s one striking fact about academic research that bears on this question: in most fields, the best few researchers get almost all the attention.

Most scientific articles get little to no attention (Van Dalen and Klamer 2005). One study found that 47 percent of articles catalogued by the Institute for Scientific Information have never been cited, and more than 80 percent have been cited less than 10 times (Redner 1998).  Articles in the median social science journal, on average, get only 0.5 citations within two years of publication (Klamer and Dalen 2002).  The mean number of citations per article in mathematics, physics, and environmental science journals is probably less than 1 (Mansilla et al. 2007).

By contrast, the top 0.1% of papers in the Institute for Scientific Information have been cited over 1000 times (Redner 1998). Citations per paper are basically distributed by a [power law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law), which means that only a few papers dominate. This trend seems to hold across fields, even when the average number of citations per article varies widely (Radicchi, Fortunato, and Castellano 2008), and a similar distribution holds across individual researchers, not just articles (Petersen et al. 2011a).

What does this skewed distribution imply for the prospects of academic research as a high-impact career? You might think it means that becoming a researcher is a sure way not to have a significant impact. But what matters is the *expected* outcome of becoming a researcher. That the best researchers get all the attention only implies that the expected outcome of becoming a researcher may be dominated by your chance of becoming a giant in your field. The expected value of a research career could nonetheless be very high if you could have an astronomical impact as a leader in your discipline, even if the chances of reaching that position are low. So it would be too hasty to infer that you shouldn’t enter research because of the skewed distribution of output and reward.

The above only applies to the extent that (a) citations are a good measure of attention, and (b) attention is a good measure of impact. There may be problems with citation measurements (Seglen 1998), and there are different ways of using citations to assess attention (Bornmann et al. 2008). But citations, publications, and reputation seem to be the currency for influencing policymakers, university officials, students, and peer scholars (Dalen and Henkens 2004). If your potential to make impact through research in your field is directly related to the amount of credit and recognition you receive (Cash et al. 2003), then the skewed distribution of citations is highly relevant to your chances of making the most difference through academic research (Faria and Goel 2010). You might, however, aim to make an impact in other way, like teaching, or your contributions might be valuable regardless of uptake by your peers.

In the next post, I’ll discuss one possible cause of this skewed distribution.

I wonder if there is a citation index that includes the citations of publications that cite you. That might help to determine how important the one-citation articles are, since they may be cited by works that are a lot more important. But if most one-citation articles lead to a dead end, then getting a citation wouldn't be such a big difference. Maybe that's irrelevant though.

I think (Petersen et al. 2011a) shows a similar distribution over individual researchers. 

Great point about different fields having different expected values.

I think the 'perverse appeal of beating the long odd's' (as my valuation (banking) lecturer used to say with regards CEOs and creating values through mergers) is perhaps better visualised by looking at careers with similar earnings distributions - say film acting or being a pro footballer.

The other day I was talking to a particularly sexy lady who was gunning for actress-style fame. "Interesting!" , I said, - "well do you feel you are talented enough to be the 0.1% who make it?".
"Talented? Unless you want to be Emma Thomas its not about talent - you need to be beautiful, super-hard-working and bloody lucky." - I think she was inspired by Kierra Knightley here, she did look quite a bit like her.

And she has a very interesting point - many actor's with banker-level salaries really are... crap. There are loads of well paid, talented actors - no argument, but that's not the point.

So you're top of your year at Cambridge and you're research papers all got huge accolade - you're the top 0.001% in terms of talent - so to what degree are you likely to be that 0.01% that write a well cited paper?

How good is the research idea? What % of the most promising research ideas actually bear fruit? 

This is a set of question's I went over and over when deciding between entrepreneur / banker and they're FASCINATING!  - If you are exceptionally talented in one area does it make more sense to go into a related field with a steeper 'power-law' distribution than a field with a better paid average? That's a huge question! Should we start recommending our best looking, most outspoken and hard-core members go into earn-to-give film acting!? THINK OF THE INFLUENCE OPPORTUNITIES!!!! 

I have a feeling the answer has very much to do with the degree that luck and contacts effect a field's success distribution. In acting I would have thought it was extremely high. In banking it feels like its very low in the medium term even if it feels high-luck in the short term. In research ... yeah I have no idea.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>816</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>David Barry</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>dw.barry@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/david-barry</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-01-08 00:35:57</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Jacob writes [this paragraph didn't show up the first time I tried to post this comment], "I wonder if there is a citation index that includes the citations of publications that cite you.

One thing to be aware of here is that, at least in the parts of physics that I was familiar with, a citation does not usually mean that the citing paper relies on the cited paper.  A large chunk of the references are made in the introduction, when you put your paper into the current broader research context ("Related experiments have recently been described in Refs. [7-35]"), and your peers might get angry if you leave out their work.

Biology papers, from memory, tended to have about twice as many references as physics papers.

That said, there's a big difference between one citation and none - if that one citation allows a discovery that wouldn't have been made, or means it occurs a year earlier, that shifts all science which will depend on that discovery forward a year. If you believe science has accelerating returns, that's still potentially a huge gain over humanity's lifespan.

Another thought - a lot of publications are written under duress from the academic system, so it's possible that the distribution of success is less skewed than you'd think from papers alone. Worth looking into if there's any way to find similar data by researcher rather than paper?

Last thought - as you say, expected value is what matters rather than prominence in your field. It's not too hard to imagine that some fields have hundreds or even thousands of times the expected value of others (cognitive enhancement vs cosmetics maybe?), in which case you could afford to be proportionately less successful in those fields to still contribute the same benefit.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>The single number that best predicts professor tenure: a case study in quantitative career planning</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/157-the-single-number-that-best-predicts-professor-tenure-a-case-study-in-quantitative-career-planning</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[*Cal Newport is the best-selling author of [So Good They Can't Ignore You](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1455509124), which argues, as we have, against the common sense careers advice 'do you what you're passionate about'.

##An Interesting Experiment

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/98/original/cal_newport.jpg?1361562774'><img alt="Cal_newport" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/98/large/cal_newport.jpg?1361562774" /></a>

*How do people succeed in academia?*

I have notebooks filled with theories about this question, but I’ve increasingly come to realize that insights of this type — built on gut instinct, not data — are close to worthless. Most knowledge work fields are complex. Breaking into their upper levels requires a deliberate effort and precision that is poorly matched to the blunt, feel-good plans we devise in bouts of blog-inspired reflection.

This was on my mind when, earlier this week, I went seeking *empirical* insight into the above prompt, and ended up designing a simple  experiment:

1. I started by identifying well-known professors in my particular niche of theoretical computer science.
2. For each such professor, I studied their former graduate students. I was looking for pairs of students who earned their PhD around the same time and went on to research positions, but then experienced markedly different levels of success in the field.
3. Once I had identified such a pair, I studied the first four years of their CVs — the crucial pre-tenure period — measuring the following variables: quantity of publications, venue of publications, and citation of published work in the period.

Each such pair provided an example of a successful and non-successful early academic career. Because both students in a pair had the same adviser and graduated around the same time, I could control for variables that are largely outside the control of a graduate student, but that can have a huge impact on their eventual success, including: school connections, quality of research group, and the value of the adviser’s research focus.

The difference in each pair’s performance, therefore, should be due to differences in their own strategy once they graduated. It was these strategy nuances I wanted to understand better.

*Here’s what I found…*


* **The successful young professors published a lot.** On average, they published 25 conference papers during their first four years. The non-successful professors published only 10. (Recall, in computer science, it’s competitive conference publications, not journal publications, that matter.) There was, however, high variance in these numbers. I was struck more by the floor function: the successful professors all published at least 4 conference papers a year (with some, but not all, publishing quite a bit more).
* **Neither the successful nor non-successful professors strayed far from the key conferences in their niche.** In theoretical computer science, each niche has its own publication venues, arranged in tiers of quality. There are also a small number of more general venues, which cover all of theoretical computer science, and which are quite competitive and prestigious. Neither of the groups I studied published much in the elite general venues. Both groups published mainly in the quality venues within their niche.
* **The *biggest* differentiating factor between the two groups was citations.** For each professor, I counted the citations for their five most cited papers published during their first four years (according to Google Scholar). The difference was staggering. The successful professors’ most cited papers from this period received, on average, over 1000 references. For the non-successful professors, the number was closer to 60.
As mentioned, I have notebooks filled with different strategies for succeeding in my research, with each such strategy focusing on a different element that struck me as important at the time.

My above experiment sweeps these compelling sounding ideas off the proverbial table, and replaces them with an approach backed by data. What matters, it tells me, is something we can call: **quality cited papers**. In more detail, how many papers per year are you publishing that: (a) are in quality venues; and (b) attracting citations?

This metric can tell me if I’m improving or not from year to year. Similarly, it provides clear feedback on which of my research directions should be dropped and which emphasized. When deciding whether to join a project, for example, I should start by estimating the expected impact on my quality cited papers value for the year. When deciding whether to apply for a particular grant, the same question should guide the decision.

This metric, in other words, plays the role for a young professor that batting average plays for a young baseball player. You might not like what it has to say, but it’s saying what you need to hear.

##Quantitative Career Planning


The above experiment is a case study of a bigger idea that intrigues me. In knowledge work, we spend shockingly little time trying to understand the reality of how people in our positions succeed. Perhaps, as I’ve [argued recently](http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/02/05/you-need-to-master-the-rules-before-you-can-reinvent-them/), we prefer our own answers to the truth, as *our* answers tend to sidestep any efforts that are *too* hard.

But it’s also possible that we simply need a better method for *seeking* these insights. The process above, which we can call ***quantitative career planning*** (a reference to the [quantified self movement](http://quantifiedself.com/) that encapsulates it), is an example of what these better methods might look like.

We're told that  investment bankers can save thousands of lives, but this seems to be predicated on an investment banker remaining an investment banker for a long time - but most investment bankers, especially coming from the place of most 80K members (new graduates) don't last very long*. Given that 80K is supposed to be developing new ways of thinking about career choice, I think the questions should be longer term. If i'm a 21 year old graduate, should I be going corporate finance/corporate law/entrepreneurial? At the moment, the advice is, when specific, about occupational choice (job choice) rather than career choice.

Frankly, I think some of the edgier topics of effective altruism, such as Ruari's question about whether the world would be better or not if human beings were to be eradicated is just dangerous. I appreciate my value system may simply not align with others in terms of those  values (that is, how I understand 'the good') that I seek to maximize (roughly, human QALYs), but it sounds like a public relations catastrophe - and I'm a dairy-reducing vegetarian, so not keen on increasing non human animal suffering. At least  in terms of who earns the most money type questions, research can be neutral about where that money is  donated.

Firstly, I don’t think 80k is ever going to be about telling people exactly what set of causes is best and demanding its members contribute only to causes within that set. They just ask people to weigh the evidence and apply as impartial a value system to it as possible, and follow their conclusions.

Secondly, probably more relevantly to you, there are people within it who’re focusing exclusively on researching such projects, both directly and looking into ways others can help them.

Thirdly, I don’t think anyone’s ever offered a sound argument that even a pure utility-maximiser should focus on exlusively on/eschew any of the causes that come under the ‘high impact’ subset. There’s a lengthy [discussion](http://www.felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=629) on this going on at Felicifia, if you’re interested.

First, I think we should never lie to or deceive people (http://lesswrong.com/lw/uw/entangled_truths_contagious_lies/). If tricky issues come up, let's address them head-on.

That said, it can make sense to focus on some points more than others depending on where the audience is. If we're approaching an audience that is just beginning to wonder if it should act altruistically, then it might be unwise to stress how complicated these issues can be. Human brains are de-motivated when issues are very much not black and white, even when the expected value of action is the same.

However, we shouldn't refrain from discussing these topics forever. It's important that we do bring up "poor meat eater" and the like when the audience is ready, because EAs make better decisions when they learn more. If poor meat eater is decisive against international aid, then so be it. If it's not (perhaps because of other factors, like wild-animal suffering), then we can explain that too.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>479</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Jesper Östman</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>jesper.ostman@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-08-18 02:34:30</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Brian: Seems reasonable.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>416</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Zander Redwood</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>editor@80000hours.org</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/zander-redwood</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-07-19 19:32:41</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Personal interest: what are the best conversion courses into subjects for subsequent expected income (also noting if they include high risk, since some will be risk averse). This is especially relevant to me, but seems like it could fit several members - anyone who's finished or soon to finish a degree that doesn't obviously lend itself to EA careers. 

In general creating some basic metrics along the lines of traditional careers advisors, so that members can get some sense of the fields they might go into.

Would probably be worth separating into a list by maximum annual salary and by hourly salary, since someone working fewer hours might be able to put the time saved into good causes too.

As a slightly lower priority, the cost effectiveness of various orgs working on climate change - I'm hoping to write a proper argument on this, but the short version is that climate change research is common enough and poorly organised enough that there might be some very low hanging fruit in identifying the best groups for an individual to support. This might be more for GWWC though.

Another possibility is field testing various approaches to persuading people of certain ethical views, esp fundamental ones. It seems like there's a lot of research on eg how to persuade people to become vegetarian, but not much on how to persuade them of norms that would affect whether they became vegetarian given the right extra stimuli (or that would persuade them to give up being veggie if it turned out to be a poor choice). I guess this is similar to Ruiari's, except that it could just be for anyone to persuade their friends/people they were stuck in an elevator with.

"eg political lobbying, editing Wikipedia, discussing politics with friends or on internet forums or blogs, studying for an hour as an undergrad student (vs blagging), voting, etc. It might be quite powerful to be able to show people just how irrelevant some of their good deeds are"

Thanks, Zander. As a matter of fact, I think some of those are quite valuable, especially when done with effective causes in mind. It's astounding how many people I've influenced by having discussions with friends and on Internet forums. And what are we doing now? :)

Yes, talking politics can often be not especially useful, but some targeted political actions may rank near the top of the effectiveness list. In any event, socializing is not necessarily a waste of time, since those connections will be valuable in other contexts (careers, soliciting donations, getting advice). I guess your point is just that people shouldn't derive undue feelings of accomplishment from merely socializing.

Editing Wikipedia may sometimes be an astonishingly effective use of time (http://reducing-suffering.blogspot.com/2009/04/save-notes-to-wikipedia.html), especially if you highlight important information that's missing or create a new page for an organization that doesn't exist. Just think of how many people read Wikipedia articles and trust the content. And search engines usually rank Wikipedia high, so your SEO comes for free.

One month ago we took on our first full-time staff members. Over this summer there will be six of us working full-time on 80,000 Hours:

**Will MacAskill** – President – working on content writing and research, external relations and strategy

**Benjamin Todd** – Managing Director – helping the rest of the team and writing content

**Richard Batty** – intern – working on developing the 80,000 Hours website and community, our careers advice service and assisting members

**Jake Nebel** – intern – researching and writing about the crucial considerations in picking research careers

**Ilan Fischer** – intern – working on researching animal welfare as a cause and helping people to find careers that reduce animal suffering

**Bastian Stern** – intern – working with Ben and Will conducting and writing up research, currently on the methodological questions of cost-effective giving

We also have the support of several great part-time volunteers and staff shared with Giving What We Can, in particular the vital operations team!

This means we have far more manpower than ever before. The most visible sign will be more blog activity – we’ll have three posts per week, so check back regularly! We’ll use the blog for the first airing of ideas that will ultimately turn into   website content. Much, much more is going on behind the scenes. First, there’s a great deal of operations to set up and training that’s going on, which will enable faster growth in the future. Second, we’re developing the 80,000 Hours concept to make it better adapted to people’s needs. Third, we’ve surveyed existing careers guidance to work out the best niche for effective altruist careers guidance, and started researching a bunch of ways to make a difference.

What are our goals over the next year? One big goal is to write a comprehensive book on evidence-based, effectiveness-focused careers advice for those who want to make a difference but don’t know how best to do so. We want to get this content into every major careers service in the UK and USA. Alongside the book, we’re developing a free, in-depth, one-on-one advice service for those wondering about how to best make a difference, whether with their careers, volunteering or philanthropy.  We’ll have further posts explaining our research and career counseling plans in more depth.

We’ll also be starting chapters in Princeton and Yale and Cambridge and intensifying our involvement in Oxford. The first 80,000 Hours meet-up was recently held in [Vancouver]( http://www.meetup.com/80-000-Hours-Vancouver/), and we’ll be starting similar groups in several other cities.

We’re really excited about what the future will bring.

Some people raise an eyebrow. “Seb,” they say as if explaining something very obvious, “if everybody quit their jobs and took a high earning career to give money to charities, then there wouldn’t be anybody to give the money to!”

To put the problem a bit more sympathetically, “80,000 Hours is trying to convince people to do [Earning to Give](/earning-to-give). So if you succeeded, by getting everyone to do it, the world would be worse off.”
But this misses the point entirely. First, so we’re all clear, 80,000 Hours doesn’t necessarily recommend Earning to Give as the best career path. It all depends on who you are and what your strengths are. Even many effective altruists (EAs) who are suited to a high earning career can do better elsewhere. 80,000 Hours is just trying to put Earning to Give on the map of possible ethical career options.

But, more importantly, we only recommend that anyone does Earning to give because we look at the way the world is and we reckon it makes a positive difference. If the world became different, and lots of people naturally decided to do Earning to Give, we’d recommend something else. 

80,000 Hours is about getting people to think seriously about the difference their career choices make. That means you have to react to evidence. There is no risk that a world where everyone is a member of 80,000 Hours would be one where everyone does Earning to give.
This ties into a debate with a long and proud tradition in the field of ethics. A certain brand of ethicist believes that one ought to do only things that you’d be satisfied to have everyone do. For example, you shouldn’t lie because if everyone lied then all communication would break down. (For these people, you shouldn’t lie even when there are compelling reasons to do so. It’s wrong even if it would save lives to lie to a murderer.)

This sort of theory has a lot of problems, and philosophers can spend a lot of time fixing little objections to it. But it’s important to realise that universalisability usually depends on a particular way of phrasing something. For example, “If everyone did Earning to Give the world would be bad” might be true, but replace "Earning to Give” with “effective altruist” and add that many EAs would do Earning to Give, and it doesn’t seem so true at all. (Also note that many things that seem unobjectionable are not universalisable. I ought not give Sally a lollipop because it wouldn’t be good if everyone gave Sally a lollipop. It also isn’t clear where we get our assessment of ‘good’ from when we work out if things would be universalisable.)

What we can agree on is fairly unobjectionable. Keep your options open and don’t rule out careers just because someone else told you they were unethical. The impact your life has on the world around you is complicated and depends on lots of factors. You have to sit down and work out whether _your_ decision to take a job makes the world worse or better. Sometimes, direct harm will be outweighed by other benefits. Sometimes, direct good will be outweighed by other harms.

We’re going to be writing in more detail about some of this in the near future, but here are some highlights from our conversation:

* **General advice for students interested in doing high impact research**: spending a lot of time thinking it through can make a big difference, and sometimes small or unglamorous innovations can have the most impact.
* **Some heuristics for finding high impact research areas**: look for under-researched fields, find problems that affect a lot of people, try adding a new twist to a big problem, being a generalist 
* **Things to be careful of**: some problems seem huge and important but might be ill-posed and so hard or even impossible to solve. “Solving consciousness” or “curing cancer” are good examples of this.
* **More specific ideas of what research questions might be promising**: certain areas of neuroscience focused on improving human well-being, communication and cooperation, anything that makes it easier to acquire or multiply human capital.
* **Why scientists aren’t working on these things and general barriers are to doing high impact research**: inheriting the research agenda of your professor seems a big problem, as well as aversion to risk and uncertainty.

**A quick biography**

Anders’ research focuses mostly on cognitive enhancement and future technologies, with particular interest in cognitive biases, technology-enabled collective intelligence, neuroethics and public policy. His background is in computer science, neuroscience and medical engineering. He did his PhD in computational neuroscience at the University of Stockholm, Sweden, focusing on neural network modelling of human memory (the focus of which he tweaked towards memory enhancement). He co-founded [Eudoxa](http://www.eudoxa.se/about.html), a think tank analysing how society and culture are changed by technology and scientific progress.

**What do you wish you’d known when you were a graduate student?**

I knew I wanted to be a scientist ever since early childhood. What a scientist was, on the other hand, I had a very uncertain view of. I figured out what science was about the time I got my PhD! Quite often we go through life without getting good advice or knowing where to ask for it. Often people in academia completely lack information about what’s going on around them. I’m still completely baffled by grant writing for example, I’ve no clue how you actually get a research grant. Which is a bit worrisome of course. If something like 80,000 Hours had existed with a subsection on academia I would have been reading that part of the website, talking to the local representative with interest.

**What general advice would you have for someone wanting to do high impact research?**

By deciding more carefully you can make a lot more difference. Be careful of just inheriting a research topic from your supervisor: this is a big problem and your advisor won’t necessarily choose the best topic for you. It’s also worth bearing in mind that sometimes small findings can do the most amazing things, and unglamorous innovations can matter a lot. Take [Norman Borlaug and the Green Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug) for example. What he did had a huge impact but wasn’t totally revolutionary. He just put the pieces together in the right way and convinced a bunch of people.

**What do you think are some good heuristics for doing high impact research?**

One idea is to go for under-researched fields. Progress in a field is typically a very convex learning curve: rapid progress at first when the low-hanging fruits get picked by the pioneers, followed by slowing progress as the problems get harder and it takes longer to learn the necessary skills to get to them. So the same amount of effort might produce far more progress in a little studied field than in a big one. (Of course, the field better matter too - computational pencil sharpening algorithms could be revolutionized by anybody investigating it, but who cares?)

“It’s going to affect a lot of people” seems to be a good heuristic. Using my own field of neuroscience as an example, it’s pretty obvious that the brain affects a lot of people: it’s a big deal! 

If you think you can add a different twist to a new problem because you have experience from another field, that can be particularly useful, as you have a better chance of having a big insight.

It can also help to turn the question around: what aspects of human life matter? Looking at human life, we sleep about a third of the time, and there’s very little research into how to enhance sleep. Understanding the health effects of what we eat is probably worth billions of pounds per year. But there are no financial incentives here. Maybe a simple approach for finding high impact research areas might be to look at the most common google searches: you can get a pretty good idea of what human behaviour matters a lot!

**What about things to be wary of: areas that might seem high impact but aren’t?**

If a problem has resisted a lot of effort, that should tell you something about it: it might be that people are coming at it from the wrong approach, so it might be high impact. But more likely that it’s a really hard problem or even an ill-posed problem. The “war on cancer” is a beautiful example of that. It made sense for Nixon to declare a war on cancer because he believed it was *a* problem, but as it was more researched it was realised that it was a lot of problems but there was no cure for cancer. Many of these “big problems” may later on turn out to be pointless, so I’m sceptical of going after them.

Being able to evaluate what you’re working on, having some kind of importance check, and setting your priorities straight is really important. This is a bit like time management: it’s a really useful skill. I’d take being able to do this over an intelligence enhancing pill!

**Do you think it’s better to be a generalist and get a broad understanding of a lot of things, or to specialise early and really focus on a single area you think is high impact?** 

I’ve found that being a generalist gives you a certain connoisseurship. It allows you to distinguish “good research” from “bad research” to some extent (although maybe not when you get into the nitty gritty details.) You can get a rough sense of what’s going on. It’s also relatively cheap to do as the learning curve is steepest at the beginning: if you just read an introductory textbook as bedtime reading, you can get on this part of the curve. I can’t do any seismology, or marketing or brain imaging, but I certainly have an idea of what’s roughly going on in these fields, which can be very useful later on. I’m very much in favour of learning loads of stuff that’s likely to turn out to be useful. Over the history of my academic career my most useful courses have been linear algebra, all the statistics and probability theory I’ve been able to pick up, some basic computer science, and a course on natural disasters. Linear algebra, for example, is very general and crops up everywhere: if you use it in a field not familiar with it you can do some really amazing stuff. Around here (at the FHI), we’re fairly good at maths and statistics, which means we can do parts of ethics that normally ethicists can’t handle. 

Even if you do focus on one field, knowing enough about other fields is good as you can recognise when you need the help of someone from another department. Far too many people have no idea at all that they can make use of other departments. Knowing how to use data is also incredibly useful. In a lot of domains people don’t look much at data. But actually being able to get that feedback from reality is so amazingly useful: that’s of course why randomized control trials are so important!

**What are some specific areas of research you think are important?**

Neuroscience in general I think: it’s a tough field and there are a lot of people working on it, but there are a ridiculous number of subfields and it’s pretty clear we don’t know much about a lot of areas. There’s a lot of focus on the neurosciences, but it’s under-resourced in the sense that the money isn’t going into the most important places. 

Things like dementia, depression: mental illness in general are an enormous drain on humanity, and if we could do something about them that could be a really big deal. Figuring out how our decision making works and making it better, and making our emotional lives better, are also going to have an enormous impact on our quality of life. But it’s a bit unclear what we’re going to find. Anything that improves communication abilities or cooperation abilities of people is going to have a huge impact: on the neural side, figuring out how to better learn languages, or how to make social media work. Plus anything that makes human capital easier to acquire and multiply: better education, cognitive enhancement, downloadable skills. Also risks of wars and democides tend to dominate the tails of my disaster distributions - reducing the risk of lethally bad governance might have a big impact.

I’ve got a specific research question that seems obvious to me and I haven’t found anybody investigating it. You have a learning system building hierarchical representations based on simpler knowledge: this is all standard deep learning stuff you find in typical textbooks. The problem is, as it continues to learn, how do you keep your representations stable? How come we don’t overlearn standard things like walking, familiar faces, or how our own bedroom looks? Typically with an artificial learning system if you show them something like this too much it will crash. How come we don’t crash when we see our own bedrooms? We seem to be completely stable against this. Understanding this would be really useful not just in artificial intelligence and neuroscience but in a lot of domains.

**Why do you think scientists aren’t already thinking like this in looking for important research questions?**

I think in general scientists are a lot less rational about what they research than they should be! There seem to be institutional reasons why people go for very narrow fields. The problem in neuroscience is that if you get into it it’s very likely your professor is going to try and niche you into some very narrow subfield: this makes for great papers but you’re probably not going to solve any important problems.  Inheriting your supervisor’s research agenda is a big problem. I ended up doing several years of memory research because of a deal between my professor and an institute: it wasn’t really my choice. In philosophy of course people typically select topics themselves, but again, do they do it for rational reasons?

**What other barriers are there to doing important research?**

Looking at some of these under-researched fields, the problem is that a lot of them don’t even exist as fields. Typically you’re unlikely to get funding in unknown fields as well: unless you’re a really good salesman! So one heuristic would be to look at the topics you know, do a matrix and look at the interactions: which areas do you see that have nobody doing anything in? 

When I went to a computational neuroscience conference last year, I was slightly depressed as I saw a poster which was exactly the same research topic as my last poster! It was pretty clear the young grad student had reached the same conclusion I did, and had never heard of my research which was published 6 years ago! Many fields have this problem that they don’t have very much of a memory, which affects progress. 

Fields like AI are struggling because there’s no good way of comparing progress. How much smarter are current general AI programs than some of the classics? Nobody knows, and you can’t test the older programs because the source code and everything has been lost except a few bizarre papers from the early 70s.

**Finally, if you could give just one piece of advice for a student wanting to really make a difference with their research, what would it be?**

Many great discoveries have been due to serendipity. But you should try to place yourself so that regardless of whether you find what you were aiming for or something different, it will really matter.

Being passionate about a career doesn’t mean you should do it. Not being passionate about a career doesn’t rule it out.

This was because there are other important components of career choice – such as making a difference, and your talents – which can outweigh your passions. This may seem obvious. A more reasonable claim is that 'do what you’re passionate about' is a heuristic for career choice – it’s not always true, but is nevertheless a useful rule of thumb. In particular, it might be a useful heuristic insofar as your career is about finding personal happiness. Even this, however, seems false. Here are the reasons 'do what you’re passionate about' is not a good heuristic for career choice.

* * *

1. **We’re bad at predicting what leads to happiness.** Equating being passionate with what makes us most happy means it’s a difficult target to aim for. A [host of biases](http://80000hours.org/blog/77-do-you-really-know-what-job-will-make-you-happy) seriously affect our ability to predict how happy or sad a state of us affairs will make us. This means, even if our only goal were happiness, following the rule 'do what you’re passionate about could lead us the wrong way.

2. **What makes us happy can change.**
Part of the reason we’re bad at predicting what leads to happiness is because we underestimate our ability to adapt to circumstances. Even after major life changes, people’s reported sense of well-being tends to revert to a baseline level. We tend to underestimate this effect, meaning that we don’t enjoy good things as much as we expect, and we don’t suffer bad things as much as we expect. This is called hedonic adaptation (1). It suggests we’ll underestimate our ability to develop passions, and will enjoy realising our passions less than we expect to. But more importantly, it’s because...

3. **Passion grows from appropriately challenging work.**
The most consistent predictor of job satisfaction is [mentally challenging work](http://80000hours.org/blog/68-how-to-find-a-job-you-ll-love) (2). Equating passion with job satisfaction, this means that we can become passionate about many jobs, providing they involve sufficient mental challenge. The requirements for mentally challenging work, like autonomy, feedback and variety in the work, are similar to those required to develop [flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29#Mechanism_of_flow). This suggests that a similar conclusion will hold if we believe that being passionate is closely connected with the ability to enter states of flow. If, however, you don’t think flow and job satisfaction are the same thing as passion, then you can still agree that...

4. **There’s more to happiness than being passionate about your work.**
Job satisfaction and flow, even if distinct from passion, are desirable in and of themselves. More importantly,[ helping others makes us happy](http://80000hours.org/blog/75-should-we-sacrifice-doing-what-we-love-to-make-a-difference-part-1). So, even if personal happiness is your only goal, there could be situations in which it’s better to seek work that allows you to make a difference, even if it’s not your passion.

5. **There are better targets to aim for.**
We’re not only bad at predicting what will make us happy, but more easily detectable predictors of job satisfaction exist (autonomy, feedback, variety, making a difference etc). This suggests it would be more useful to aim at these predictors rather than directly at what we think we’re passionate about.  Similarly, it could be more useful to focus on being good at what you do. First, this is a more positive mindset, focused on contributing rather than taking. Second, being good at what you do makes you better placed to ask for engaging work.

6. **Most people aren’t passionate about anything, at least not anything that can get you a job**
The advice 'do what you’re passionate about' has [prompted some to worry]( http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/12/change-your-life-passions) that they don’t have any passions. This isn’t unreasonable – not everyone has one special activity they love doing. One 2002 study of Canadian students showed that 84% had passions, but these were mostly sports and music. Only 4% had passions that were relevant to work (4). In these cases, 'do what you’re passionate about' is actively harmful, since you don't have a useful passion to begin with. This advice merely prompts anxious soul-searching.

7. **What do you do if you have several passions, or passions that aren’t easily turned into a job?**
Many people have passions that aren’t easily turned into jobs, either because they are too niche, lots of people have the same passions (so there’s too much competition), or they’re not sufficiently talented (the short basketball player). If you’re passionate about several things, is it better to combine these passions? Suppose the basketball player is also passionate about kung fu. Should he try to make his name combining kung fu and basketball? Again, focusing on passion leads to probably futile soul-searching.

8. **Don’t turn your passion into a job.**
Often, we enjoy our passions – sports, cooking, photography, travel, and so on – precisely because we’re not pursuing them to earn money. Psychologists have shown that introducing an external reward (like money) for something that we find inherently enjoyable, can reduce our [intrinsic motivation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivation) (motivation driven by interest in the task itself)(3). Attempting to turn our passions into work could ruin what we most enjoy.

* * *
 
So 'do what you’re passionate about' isn’t a good heuristic for career choice, even if you’re aiming only at personal happiness. Nevertheless, that doesn’t mean that effective altruists should ignore their prospective happiness in choosing careers. As we will explore in the following sequence, even if your main goal is making a difference, it’s still important to think about what will make you happy in your career.

Imagine you’re offered the top job at [SCI](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto) – one of the [world’s most cost-effective charities]( http://givewell.org/charities/top-charities) – should you take it?

SCI’s historical annual budget has been just under $10m (1). With $10m, SCI is able to provide 20 million children with medicine that prevents neglected tropical diseases each year (2). We’d expect this to lead to 250,000 years of extra healthy life per year (3), as well as to yield long-term education and economic benefits to the millions of people in the affected area (4).

A 10% improvement to SCI’s efficiency means treating an extra 2 million children and creating an extra 25,000 years of healthy life per year. That’s roughly equivalent to saving 800 lives per year (5). So, a small improvement to SCI’s efficiency is a big deal. The same would go for someone who could fundraise an extra 10% for SCI.

Whether you could increase SCI’s impact by 10% is a tough question, and given the organisation’s extreme efficiency, we have reason to be sceptical. But one issue that bears on the question is the following: **how much do different employees typically differ in output?**

</br>

<center><a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/10/original/sci.JPG?1344957128'><img alt="Sci" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/10/large/sci.JPG?1344957128" /></a></center>

</br>

There have been many studies looking at this very question, across a wide range of jobs, which are summarised in a meta-study by Hunter, Schmidt and Judiesch (6). Output is measured in a variety of ways. For salespeople, it’s the dollar value of what they sell. For doctors, it could be the number of patients seen and treated. Other studies have been done with standardised tests, supervisor ratings and many other metrics (7). I should flag that it’s not clear how well these metrics correlate with the real *value* produced by jobs, but I’ll run with them for now.

What they found is that in low complexity jobs, workers' outputs do not vary much, and the best worker is usually not much better than the average worker. As the jobs become more complex however, there's more and more variation, and the difference between the best worker and the average grows. For example, in low-complexity jobs the top 10% of workers produce 25% more than the average, and 75% more than the bottom 10%. **For high-complexity jobs, such as professional  and sales jobs, the difference is much larger. The top 10% of workers produce 80% more than the average, and 700% more than the bottom 10%** (8).

Taking these findings literally suggests that the bottom 3% of workers in professional jobs have negative output. Hunter, Schmidt and Judiesch believe this is unlikely, and interpret it to mean that the distribution is not a perfect bell-curve, but instead stops around zero output (it's probably log-normal instead). I agree that it’s unlikely that someone’s *direct* output could be negative for long before they were fired. Imagine if a doctor killed more patients than he treated. But if we think about all the indirect effects someone can have on an organisation, like decreasing team morale and consuming lots of supervisor time, then it’s not implausible that some people have an overall negative contribution.

The methods used to measure output often don’t take these indirect effects into account. They tend to focus on what each employee did directly, e.g. the number of insurance contracts sold or the number of patients treated. This would suggest the studies significantly understate the differences in output that really matter.

The crudeness of the metrics will be another reason why the figures might tend to underestimate the true variability in output. For instance, 'the number of patients treated' gives some indication of the output of different doctors, but some treatments are better than others. Curing 100 patients of sore throats is not as good as curing 100 patients of cancer. So, there another important type of variation that's being missed.

So, among charity managers and fundraisers, it would be normal for a good one to be about twice as good as an average one, and many, many times better than a bad one. Being 10% better than your replacement at the top of a charity, therefore, could be quite achievable. And very high impact.

okay - here's is a premise: A talent market for High Impact.
You can get better paid doing the same thing for private companies than you can at charities - just as Google get better talent than they pay for because they are an awesome place to work charities get better talent than they pay for because working for a charity has value to an employee in itself. just like working for Google. (lets ignore any long term effects working in the charity industry has on your 'talents') 

so it stands to reason that working for a high-impact charity also has intrinsic value to an employee - be it logical or prestige based. The more motivation people have to apply to a firm the more people will apply and the lower the talent gap between candidates - so I would argue that as High Impact becomes sexier ~HIEL GIVEWELL!!!~ so will the potential to make a difference in high impact charities. is this diminishing marginal returns?

So i'm not pursuaded by this argument - I would be inclined to class working at well-known charities similarly to research. In a charity there are rain makers and rain collectors.

Funelling talent that does want to work at charities towards high impact charities seems as meritable a cause as GiveWell's but it seems to me that if you want to be high impact by working for a charity you need to go to a high impact charity where the guy you replace wasn't motivated by it being a high impact charity.

Hey - I would love to read an argument on High Impact Career Arbitrage - i.e. looking for high impact careers that are poorly staffed for some reason and then taking advantage of that... starting to sound like a hedge fund? great!]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>545</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Benjamin Todd</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>benjamin.john.todd@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/benjamin-todd</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-09-24 10:55:08</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Austin, we get lots of other feedback saying the articles are too long! Our approach is to build shorter posts into sequences. For instance, we've now got around 7000 words on the complex relationship between happiness and making a difference with your career, which is summarised here: http://80000hours.org/happiness-and-your-career
This post is going to work with many more in describing replaceability.

That said, I think your comments area  bit unfair. Rather than arguing that output is difficult to measure, I argued that there are some commonly used ways to measure it, which are likely to underestimate the true variability. So, the 45% standard deviation figure for high-complexity jobs found by the meta-study is an underestimate of the true variability. Being 10% better than your replacement is achievable (or perhaps it would be better to say 'realistic') in the sense that if the standard deviation is 45%, then a large fraction of people are 10% better than the mean. (and the true variability is even larger). In other words, you should expect 10% differences between people to be common. The topic of how to actually achieve a 10% increase in your output is huge, and will vary from job to job.

They tend to focus on what each employee did directly, e.g. the number of insurance contracts sold or the number of patients treated. This would suggest the studies significantly understate the differences in output that really matter."

I don't think this is right. The study looks at the standard deviation of employee output *as a percentage of mean employee output*. If we have two (or more) different sorts of output, each with the same sort of distribution as the original then:
1. With perfect correlation of the different outputs we would see exactly the same percentage standard deviation.
2. With imperfect correlation between the different outputs you would end up with lower standard deviation (as a percentage of the mean), as differences in one output get cancelled with differences in another.

That is if you don't have reason to expect there to be greater variation in the unobserved outputs than the observed ones, then the existence of these unobserved outputs suggests that the original estimates are an *overestimate* of  total variation, not an underestimate.

On the other if the observed output measure is a factor in a product of factors rather than a term in a sum (such as the emaple of measuring patients treated which then has to be multiplied). Then generally the existence of variation in the other factors *would* likely make an estimate of the variation based on just the observed factor an underestimate unless the various factors are strongly negatively correlated. ]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1361</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Benjamin Todd</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>benjamin.john.todd@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/benjamin-todd</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-10-04 16:00:45</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[that's a great point]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Estimation - Part II: How much will you earn?</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/171-estimation-part-ii-how-much-will-you-earn</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[##What can we use estimates for?

*How much could I earn during my life as a lawyer? How many people could this campaign reach? How long will it take to complete this research?* There are lots of figures that would be extremely useful to planning your career, but that are highly uncertain. Rather than making a direct estimate, it’s better to break these questions down into a number of sub-questions.

For these sub-questions we can use the four techniques (the equivalent bet, the absurdity test, avoiding anchoring and listing pros and cons) learnt in [Part 1](http://80000hours.org/blog/170-how-to-make-estimates-part-i) of this post to make calibrated Confidence Intervals (CIs).

We can then combine these individual estimates to answer our original question, and once we have done this for a number of different options we can compare them to make decisions about our future career.

In the following post we will therefore be looking at:
* How we can combine individual estimates to answer complex career questions
* How to compare different career options.
* How we can improve our estimates

##Combining estimates

In order to look at how to combine estimates we will consider the question posed above; *‘What are my expected lifetime earnings if I choose a legal career?’*

After a bit of thought we decide that in order to create a simple linear model for this calculation we need to know how much is the initial salary at the graduate level, final salary at the executive level and how long it will take for us to progress from the graduate level to the executive level. For now we are going to ignore other factors such as how likely I am to get to the top of my firm and historic trends in pay levels.

We have already looked at ways to find out salary information in another [blog post](http://80000hours.org/blog/158-how-to-find-out-earnings-for-different-jobs) and following from this we used information from [Salary.com](http://www.salary.com/) to make a number of 80% CI’s for the numbers we are interested in:
* Graduate Lawyer: 			$66,024 - $129,064
* Top Legal Executive: 		$195,145 - $728,587
* Time to reach top salary: 		5 - 30 years

A model[^1] for calculating Lifetime Earnings might split our career into two phases, one where our salary is increasing as we progress towards the executive level, and a second phase where our salary stays at executive level.

How do we combine these figures when each variable is a range, as is the case with our 80% CIs, instead of a single value.

First we might think of just picking the median value of each CI. In this case our lifetime earnings would be $15,000,000. But as we mentioned in [Part 1](http://80000hours.org/blog/170-how-to-make-estimates-part-i) a single value isn’t of much use as it doesn’t give us any information about our level of uncertainty and is very unlikely to be correct.

We could put the best and worst values for each sub-estimate into two separate calculations and then use the answers to these as the upper and lower bounds for the overall 80% CI of lifetime earnings? This also turns out to be a bad idea as the final range often ends up being too wide, particularly in more complex problems with more variables, due to the fact that most of the time we will get a combination of all the values, some high, some low, rather than expecting to routinely get all values as either high or low[^2]. 

In fact the best way to combine estimates is to use the Monte Carlo Method[^3]. This method involves picking a number at random from within each range and performing the calculation. You then pick new numbers and repeat the calculation. By doing this thousands of times you can examine your results to see the final distribution for your original question. More information on this method can be found in the notes[^1] at the end of this page as well as ‘How to Measure Anything’[^4].

We have carried out a Monte Carlo Simulation for the expected earnings in a legal career which can be seen on this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiktArl7Q4lcdEZaZHRkbHFXTm15S1ZqeG1hU2dxR0E#gid=0). And the results can be seen in the graph below.
<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/118/original/chart3.png?1364488607'><img alt="Chart3" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/118/large/chart3.png?1364488607" /></a>

By performing these calculations we provide ourselves with as much information as we can when it comes to analysing our results. From the data we know that the mean lifetime earnings are $15.4m and that our 80% CI is $6.8m to $24.4m. We also have the option of combining this distribution with other estimates we have made if we are trying to answer an even more complex question.

##Ways of comparing estimates?

In the case of earning to give we will want to compare the expected lifetime earnings for a legal career to one of our other options, in this case a financial career[^5]. 

We could pick out single values, such as the mean or median, and compare these, but this doesn’t take into account the uncertainty in our estimates. One useful figure would be the probability that earnings are greater for a legal career than for a financial career. 

In this example the expected earnings for a legal career are $15.4m and for a financial career they are $19.5m, we also know that there is around a 35% chance (according to this model) that we will earn more if we choose a legal career than if we choose a financial career.

With these results we would choose to take up a career in the financial industry and we know that we have a 65% chance that we are making the right decision. We might ask ourselves whether this is an acceptable level of confidence to have for such a big decision?

##Can we improve our estimates?

At the moment we have a 65% level of confidence that we will make the right decision if we go into banking. For any model it is possible to improve the accuracy of results by following two courses of action:
* Increase the level of detail of the model.
* Reduce the uncertainty of our individual estimates.

In the case of earning to give we might increase the level of detail by taking into account factors such as historical salary variation or the probability of being promoted at each level based on our ability. In order to reduce our uncertainty we might be able to narrow the range for some of our 80% CIs. This means that when we select values for our Monte Carlo Simulation they more accurately reflect the actual outcome, and this follows through to increase the accuracy of our final estimate.

The problem is that increasing our confidence takes additional time and, possibly, money. The key question is *‘Is it worth spending this extra money in order to increase our chances of making the right choice?’* Working this out properly requires a Value of Information calculation which we will be covering in a future blog post.

[^3]: The Monte Carlo method

    The Monte Carlo method is a ‘brute force’ computing method, where thousands of different calculations are carried out to provide thousands of different answers. By analysing the distribution of these answers we can then work out the probabilities of the different outcomes.

    One of the most important things with a Monte Carlo simulation is to ensure that we are selecting the right numbers to plug into our calculations. To do this we treat each variable as a different statistical distribution, and use a spreadsheet to randomly select the numbers within these distributions. As each distribution has different properties we need to choose them carefully to ensure that they suit our different variables. Some commonly used distributions are the *Normal, Log-Normal Binary* and *Uniform* Distributions, information on their characteristics as well as their applications can be found in *How to Measure Anything* (see below).

- assumes independence of the three parameters
- assumes top executive salaries are normally distributed
both of which seem fairly suspicious.

Also, shouldn't people who are earning to give be risk-neutral (i.e., pretty much only care about expectation, not variance) since the risks average out over all the other people who are also earning to give?

This can actually vary quite easily by person: if you've the got the right software set up and you know how to use it, then it could be pretty much as fast as a back-of-the-envelope calculation, and you might as well use it instead. But if you'd need to learn how to, it's unclear the benefit would be worthwhile compared to other ways you could spend your time, even restricting to other ways to get better information for the same decision.

You're right that if you're risk neutral with respect to money then you just care about expected earnings so can avoid anything more complicated, but there are some complications. What you're comparing aren't really expected earnings figures, where your future earnings would be drawn from a corresponding distribution X; they're estimates of expected earning distributions. And you might well be able to devote resources to improving the estimates. Jonathan talks about this tradeoff. 

Let's say your estimate of X is drawn from its own distribution Y. What you really want to compare is the expected variance not of X, but of the expectations of X in Y. (Sorry, don't think that's very clear.)

The point is that if you're pretty confident that even with better information your estimates for the expected earnings in the first job would be higher than the second, you can happily commit without gathering more information. If you think everything is uncertain enough that more information might well tip your estimates the other way, it could well be worth spending a bit more time.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>1024</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Living to 1000: an interview with Aubrey de Grey</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/42-living-to-1000-an-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[In his recent [talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDJ_IjMwT20&context=C40174a6ADvjVQa1PpcFOEBMV6ytjvTudCo5CPyIuBqysnQTTFpls=), Aubrey de Grey argued that the [SENS foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SENS_Foundation)’s life extension research should be the most important project for any effective altruist. I recommend listening to the talk before reading the interview below, but it’s not essential.

Similarly, more information on [SENS’s anti-ageing research](http://www.sens.org/sens-research/research-themes) is available for them that want it.

On with the questions, then - as in the interview with Luke Muehlhauser I’ve separated them into a section for people interested in working in gerontology and a section for people interest in supporting it in other ways.

# Questions for potential supporters

_**ZR**: It seems like you gain interest from the same sorts of people who might be interested in SIAI, especially given that you’re an adviser to the group. But the mercenary question remains - given finite resources, which organisation should we prioritise? Here’s the key argument Luke Muehlhauser gave for SIAI:_

> In the next two centuries we will have a multitude of chances to destroy ourselves with powerful new technologies. AI looks like it may be one of the first existential threats to be created. But unlike the others, doing AI _right_ can actually _prevent_ the other existential risks from happening. There is no more important thing humanity can do.

_Do you think friendly AI will not be as good at fixing the world’s problems as longer-lived humans, do you just rate the latter as much more likely to happen soon, or is there some other reason you’d advocate the SENS Foundation over them?_

**AdG**: I've never been convinced that the elimination of humans all in one go is all that much worse than the elimination of humans on a steady schedule of 150,000 per day. The only difference seems to be that in the latter case there get to be more people in the long run - but so what? One thing that does make defeating aging particularly important is that aging doesn't just kill people, it generally puts them through an extended period of disease and disability and general misery beforehand.

However, I strongly support the goal of AI, because success in that area  - if, as Luke says, it's done right - will indeed solve all other technological problems, including the development of medicine to defeat aging. But yes, I do think that there will probably be be quite a lot of progress in combating aging before we get to proper AI, so I think the approach which will save the most lives in the long run is to pursue both approaches as aggressively as possible.

_**ZR**: How confident are you about the success of your program? I’ll paraphrase a couple of off-the-cuff remarks on the subject you made in your 80,000 Hours talk:
‘We’ll get to robust human rejuvenation - within the next 25 years with 50% probability.’
‘I’d give a 10% chance we won’t get there for 100 years.’
Would you modify these now you’re not on the spot? What exactly do you mean by robust human rejuvenation? Is that the same thing as reaching what you call the ageing escape velocity? (for the benefit of readers: the point at which progress in our ability to extend our lifespans surpasses the rate at which we age, effectively making us immune to age-related death)_

**AdG**: I still stand by both those statements, but please note that I always add the caveat that the former depends on adequate funding, especially in the coming decade. I define "robust human rejuvenation" as the addition of 30 years of extra healthy life to those who are already 60 when the therapies are first given. Longevity escape velocity is different - it's the postponement of aging faster than time is passing, which results from continued progress in improving the comprehensiveness of the therapies. The moment at which we reach LEV, which we call the Methuselarity (and we're pretty sure there will be inly one such moment, i.e. that once we exceed LEV we will never fall below it again), will probably occur at around the same time when we achieve RHR - maybe a little sooner, maybe a little later.

_**ZR**: How much of your optimism is focused around the success of the research program you described to us? Suppose that were to fail entirely, would you still predict a reasonable chance of the same positive outcomes?_

**AdG**: I'm pretty certain that the SENS approach, i.e. regenerative medicine against aging, is far more promising than any other. However, it's certainly quite possible that details of what particular therapies will be involved will change as the research moves forward.

_**ZR**: How (much) has your confidence changed in say the last 10 years of your research, both in the probability of your own success and any alternative programmes?_

**AdG**: Very little. Things have gone pretty much as fast as I'd have predicted given the level of available funding.

_**ZR**: Come to that, can I ask you for your views on other gerontological research programmes? Are there any you’d be willing to single out as being particularly (un)worthy? In particular, if yours were to fail (or succeed) tomorrow such that no further progress were possible, is there somewhere else you’d advocate putting money?_

**AdG**: Most biogerontology research is useful one way or another, because it improves our understanding of aging. That can lead to the identification of new avenues for intervention, and also to refinements of the SENS approach.

_**ZR**: Let me put you in the crosshairs for a bit: Gwern from Less Wrong has written a rather gloomy [prognosis](http://www.gwern.net/Mistakes#near-singularity) of our near technological future. If his view is right, does it imply that the chance of reaching what the ageing escape velocity soon would be lower than you predict? Or perhaps even that we could temporarily reach it, but that we might get a bunch of quick gains from technology and then start dying of old age somewhat later than we currently do?_

**AdG**: I don't think current trends in rates of increase in longevity really tell us anything about how soon LEV will arrive, no.

_**ZR**: You’ve drawn some aggressive criticism for the methods you propose for curing aging. The most direct engagement I found with the science was the MIT Technology Review’s [Life Extension Pseudoscience and the SENS Plan](http://www.technologyreview.com/sens/docs/estepetal.pdf). Have you written anything extensive in response to these (or comments like them) that we can read online?_

**AdG**: Yes, of course I have! The piece was not written by MIT TR, but by a few gerontologists in submission to a prize competition that they organised with my cooperation, and the rules were that I would write a rebuttal of each submission and the two would be evaluated by a panel of five neutral experts (which included Craig Venter). Naturally, no entry (including this one) succeeded in persuading the panel. My rebuttal is here:

  [http://www.technologyreview.com/sens/docs/estepetal_rebuttal.pdf](http://www.technologyreview.com/sens/docs/estepetal_rebuttal.pdf)

and the report of the whole prize process is here:

which also has links to the other entries and my corresponding rebuttals.

_**ZR**: I’ll let you down from the gallows now. Do your calculations of economic benefit take into account the cost of turning a baby into a productive adult, and the fact that longer life improves the ratio?_

**AdG**: They can include that, yes, but the main factors to consider are the results of increased health. Having no sick people to look after will make society astronomically wealthier.

_**ZR**: Back to matters financial... How much funding would your programme actually need to complete its goals? Paraphrasing your talk again, you guesstimated ‘$50,000,000 allocated appropriately would be “enough for the next while”’. Can you be a bit specific about what ‘the next while’ means?_

**AdG**: I think I said $50M per year. 20M/year would be a good start, and I think above $100M/year we'd be reaching diminishing returns. This is tiny compared to (for instance) the NIH budget, but that's because it's only the budget for the next several years, when the key work will be on mice rather than humans.

_**ZR**: Perhaps more importantly, do you have a sense of how valuable funding on the margins is – eg if someone were thinking of giving $25 in the near future, can you guesstimate exactly what that donation would gain? I’ll give you the same impossible challenge I gave Luke Muehlhauser - can you try to compare it to the (already very rough) [one DALY’s worth of expected benefit](http://80000hours.org/blog/6-the-best-causes-updated) from giving it to Against Malaria Foundation? And can you give an idea of what that $25 would be used for?_

**AdG**: It's pretty clear that a dollar makes more difference when spent on early-stage biomedical research (which is what we'd spend it on) than on the delivery of existing therapies.

_**ZR**: Can I press you for a guesstimate of expected value? Such data might be very relevant if one is considering eg soliciting donations from aquaintances who're significantly less likely to donate to something that sounds so much less tangible than giving money to the poor._

**AdG**: Well, the thing is that there's no new life expectancy to replace the old one with. If you save a kid from malaria you change their life expectancy by a finite amount, but here it's an indefinite amount. So I guess the answer has to be infinite.

_**ZR**: You addressed in the talk personal identity objections to indefinite life (they seem irrelevant to me, but some people think they’re important...), and your response was that we generally get along from day to do without worrying about it - that if we think we’ll be the same person tomorrow, we should assume that we’ll be the person in two days time, etc. But this doesn’t strictly follow - one could see identity as a question of degree, such that after a while you really are talking about a different person. If so then it might still make sense to say that some minimum amount of life is rationally desirable, but then it doesn’t make sense to desire it any longer. Can you offer an argument for people who believe that that minimum amount of desirable life is greater than a day, but less than our typical lifespans?_

**AdG**: Sure. The practical implication of the day-at-a-time argument is not that we should care as much about our distant-future self as about tomorrow-self, but rather that however long we live we will always care about our next-day self. So developing medicine to stay healthy for as long as we live is just forward planning, in terms of our self-regard as well as in terms of our wish to stay healthy.

_**ZR**: You’re obviously a techno-optimist, and your concept of the longevity escape velocity explicitly requires constantly improving technology so that we can stay on the right side of senescence. But given the imminent [peaking of various resources](http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2011/05/31/peak-oil-peak-water-peak-resources-peak-planet-building-a-currency-for-the-21st-century/), isn’t it quite likely that our functional technology will decline at various points in the 21st century? If so, how much will that threaten your estimates of expected gain?_

**AdG**: If you look at the numbers, it's vanishingly unlikely that that will make any difference. This is especially so when you notice that LEV actually slows down as time goes by - i.e., the further we suppress the damage of aging, the less rapidly we need to suppress it further in order to maintain LEV.

_**ZR**: How well do you expect the treatment, assuming it success elsewhere, to work on degradation of the brain? Surely that would be much harder to maintain than the rest of the body?_

**AdG**: No, not much harder (if at all). The brain is far more complex, so its operation is far harder to understand, but SENS doesn't require understanding of operation - it only requires characterisation of the changes to molecular and cellular composition. If we restore that composition to that of a young adult, we're done.

_**ZR**: Given the relative modesty of the money you described above, it seems amazing you don’t get more funding from - how to put this - the less benevolent members of the super-rich community (I gather you’ve had some generous interest from Peter Thiel). If your research is going to bear fruit, it would be insane of the wealthier member of societies not to funnel large amounts of their income into it, and encourage their peers to do the same. The same people are far less likely to support purely altruistic causes like AMF, so it seems like arguments for 80,000 Hours members supporting SENS suffer from [replaceability effect](http://80000hours.org/blog/35-the-replaceability-effect-working-in-unethical-industries-part-1) which underlies much of the 80,000 Hours philosophy. I suppose there are two questions here - why you haven’t got more funding from such sources - and whether a professional philanthropist or similar who agreed with your organisation would do better to pass the word around to his less altruistic colleagues but then get on with funding more selfless goals._

**AdG**: There are many reasons people have for not supporting this work financially, and by and large they are not rational reasons - they are the same sort of reasons why people don't support it verbally. Some people support it verbally but not financially, and that's typically because their wives are against it, or something like that. Grim but true.

_**ZR**: If people do want to get involved, are there any non-financial ways in which people can contribute, particularly at low opportunity cost? For example computer cycles to a relevant research program, crowd-sourcing opportunities they can distract their less productive friends with, etc?_

**AdG**: Many ways - too many to list here. Check the [FAQ](http://sens.org/take-action) at sens.org, or [write to us](http://sens.org/contact-us).

# Careers in gerontology

_**ZR**: Easy question to kick off: please talk about yourself :) More specifically, can you describe (in as much detail as you like) a typical working week? How many hours would you put in, what proportion of them would be spent on work you find engaging and what on admin/other chores? More importantly, what, physically do you do in what proportion from day to day? Can you give a sense of the highs and lows of the job? What about others from your organisation and others like it? (I basically want to give people thinking of actually working in gerontology as vivid a possible a description of what their life would be like)_

**AdG**: Well, my life is very far from typical for a career in gerontology! As the global spearhead (and figurehead, I suppose) of the crusade to bring aging under complete medical control, I spend an large amount of my time doing interviews, which most people do none of, and lectures, which most people do not many of and only to other scientists rather than to general audiences. Also, when I'm not doing outreach I mainly spend my time advising and connecting other scientists - I don't do any bench science myself. Ifind all of these activities engaging and fulfilling - it's an immense privilege to have the chance to spend all my time doing the thing I most want to do it the whole world, namely to hasten the solution of humanity's single biggest problem.

The work of a typical gerontologist - and here I refer to biogerontologists, who study the biology of aging, rather than clinical gerontologists (aka geriatricians) or social gerontologists - is actually not materially different from that of any other bench scientist. You do experiments, you do them again and again until they work, you talk about them, you write them up for publication, you ask the government for money for the next experiment - you get the idea. But of course you also get at least a little of what I get: the satisfaction of knowing that you're contributing to solving humanity's worst problem.

_**ZR**: What about a slightly atypical week? What sort of events of note happen rarely, but reliably?_

**AdG**: Days off!

_**ZR**: Now let’s suppose you’ve won some readers over. What attributes would someone thinking about going into gerontological research ideally have? How much competition is there?_

**AdG**: Competition is certainly not the issue. Excessive competitiveness is actually a major handicap in science, because it encourages one to study things that other people are already studying, and thus it minimises one's chance of actually making much of a difference. I'd say the main attributes are determination and patience, which are vital for any scientist, and humanitarian drive, which gives the translational focus that anyone working on really hard technlogical (including medical) research needs.

_**ZR**: I was thinking more of the type of competition that would make it hard to get work in the field at all - if someone studied science with this kind of career in mind, roughly how outstanding would they need to be to expect to find work in it? How much would just studying the most relevant fields compensate for a lack of natural ability if they were prepared to work hard - and what would those fields be?_

**AdG**: There's certainly not that much competition. Aging is so complicated that the best way to get to be good at studying it is to get a very general biology education. However, for the same reason, people with specialist expertise in pretty much any subfield of biology can also do research that's relevant to combating aging.

_**ZR**: I’ll end with a quick plug for your book,  _[Ending Aging](http://80000hours.org/blog/6-the-best-causes-updated)_. Given the rate of progress in the field, though, can you predict how much longer it will be worth reading for? Any plans for an updated edition?_

**AdG**: It's still worth reading! No major changes have occurred to SENS - mostly what has happened is just progress in the very directions that we discussed and predicted in the book.

_**ZR**: Lastly can you recommend any further reading for anyone wanting to really immerse themselves in the scholarship on (bio)gerontology?_

**AdG**: Once you've read _Ending Aging_, the only real place to go is the [sens.org](http://sens.org/) website, where we have a regular blog on the key advances in the relevant fields.

Assume that the research programme will be successful (this is a very large assumption, of course, and I'm only making it here for the argument's sake).  Assume further that some amount of money is needed to be spent on this research before success is achieved (this could do with some tweaking - research might be more efficient per dollar with a larger number of researchers).  Then a failure to donate $25 delays the research coming to fruition by the time it would otherwise take to raise that $25.

SENS's annual report shows an annual revenue of about $1.5 mn, which is an average of about $170/hour.  So a failure to donate $25 delays the success of this research by about 10 minutes.

Then you'd need to work out how many people cross the threshold from "able to have their lives extended" to "unable to have their lives extended" in those 10 minutes.  Beneficiaries of these life extensions will mostly be affluent countries, so I'll estimate from Australia's mortality rate (which I have at hand) - about 6 per 1000 annually, or about 10^-4 per 1000 every 10 minutes.  What will the global affluent population be later this century?  Ballpark guess of 3 billion.  That translates to about 300 lives potentially extended in that 10-minute window.

Mortality rates will hopefully continue to decline over the coming century, reducing the potential impact of the donation.  And when calculating an expectation value, we'd need a probability that the research programme will work, and a guess of how many people on the threshold would choose for the life extension.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>252</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Nick Beckstead</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>nbeckstead@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/nick-beckstead</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-04-13 16:20:36</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[> Assume that the research programme will be successful (this is a very large assumption, of course, and I'm only making it here for the argument's sake).

Some natural complaints about this model:

* It is likely that there will be diminishing marginal returns to research within years (since the best researchers are funded first) and you probably get the bad end of this if you donate.
* Future research efforts are likely to yield more insights per dollar because of advances in related fields.

But this doesn't seem like a crazy first pass.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>On triage</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/49-on-triage</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[Effective altruism focuses on efficiency. Any action that fails to effect the maximum possible benefit is considered suboptimal. But isn't this standard for use of one's time and money too harsh? As long as one is making some sort of positive impact on the world, isn't that enough? Can't one live ethically without devoting all of one's energy and attention to helping others?

Here's a relevant scenario:

> Imagine a military doctor who comes across a battlefield laden with hundreds of injured soldiers in severe pain. The doctor calls for assistance, but the additional medical units will not arrive for thirty minutes. However, the doctor happens to have with him a bag of pain medicine that he can use to palliate the suffering around him. Would it be acceptable for him to treat five of the soldiers and then stop to read a comic book, arguing that he has produced some positive change in aggregated welfare and he needn't spend all of his effort helping others? Similarly, would we countenance his decision to spend most of his limited supply of pain killer on the mildly injured patients nearest to him, even though many of those a bit farther away are in absolute agony? I believe that the answers ought to be ‘no’. Rather, triage - giving greatest medical attention to those who can be helped most in the least amount of time - represents the ethical imperative under these circumstances.

Yet how are other situations any different? In choosing how to spend one's time, what to do with one's money, what to pursue in one's career, and how to devote one's life, we are making the same choice as the doctor wondering whether to treat suffering patients or read a comic book; the only difference is that the consequences of the latter option are not so immediate and tangible. Similarly, decisions as to which efforts to pursue and which actions to undertake are tantamount to the choice that the doctor faces regarding which patients to treat. Those who say, ‘I realize that this undertaking will not relieve as much suffering as possible, but at least I'm doing something,’ are in effectively the same position as the doctor who treats only those mildly injured patients nearest to him, because he is ‘at least doing something’.

But isn't this focus on efficiency cold-hearted? Doesn't strict triage neglect the pain of those who don't get preferential treatment? As an illustration of this objection, I recall one scene from _And the Band Played On_ - a film about the first years of medical encounter with HIV - in which one character scoffed at a legitimate concern about a large pecuniary expenditure, saying that it was insensitive to care about money when lives were at stake.

In the real world, though, we can't do everything. Resources are limited, and we inevitably face choices between helping one being or another. Triage is not an act of harshness; it represents the highest form of mercy and compassion.

This means that a person in such a position does active harm if they do not fulfill their assigned duties, compared to not entering the position in the first place, because they were counted on by others.

A private individual may argue that there already are professional positions, institutions and resources officially devoted to solving certain altruistic problems. For instance, it may be politically assumed that alleviating poverty is a government's responsibility, and while private donations are certainly paiseworthy, they have the indirect effect of reducing pressure on bad governments who should have fulfilled their role effectively instead.

Of course, altruists who find themselves in a world in which there is suffering for which no one has officially taken responsibility (e.g. wild animals), or institutions and officials not doing their job properly, will still feel a responsibility to compensate for that. But in some such cases the most effective altruistic action may be to create or publicly insist on the responsibility of relevant professionals and institutions rather than engage in - potentially psychologically unsustainable - patterns of self-sacrifice.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>399</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Hedonic Treader</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>goldfeder@web.de</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-07-10 22:34:03</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Sorry, a part of my comment was cut off.

I think that the most ethical thing to do is help as much as you can.

I'd like to add a nuance to the idea though. What matters most is somebody's "willpower heart rate". I liken it to a school where gym class isn't judged in terms of absolute performance, but in terms of heart rate. If somebody's naturally awful at jogging, but has a heart rate of 80% her maximum capacity during her run, she's trying her darndest and is given an A.

The explicit reasoning of how this applies to being an effective altruist is as follows:

Premise 1: To choose to help 100 suffering strangers over 1 suffering friend can be emotionally challenging. It can also be hard to compel yourself to give away large portions of your income. Essentially, it takes willpower to be an effective altruist.

Premise 2: Research has found that willpower is like a muscle. It gets stronger with exercise, gets tired, and is limited (1).

Conclusion 1: If people have a certain maximum willpower ability, and if their "willpower heart rate" is at maximum capacity for helping people, saying they should give more is asking the impossible. It's like asking Gandhi to bench press as much as Arnold Schwarzenegger. Instead, people should be placed on the ethical spectrum based on how high their willpower heart rate is relative to their max, not their absolute willpower ability.

Conclusion 2: to increase our ability to be altruistic, we can increase our willpower strength

This means that a person in such a position does active harm if they do not fulfill their assigned duties, compared to not entering the position in the first place, because they were counted on by others.

A private individual may argue that there already are professional positions, institutions and resources officially devoted to solving certain altruistic problems. For instance, it may be politically assumed that alleviating poverty is a government's responsibility, and while private donations are certainly paiseworthy, they have the indirect effect of reducing pressure on bad governments who should have fulfilled their role effectively instead.

Of course, altruists who find themselves in a world in which there is suffering for which no one has officially taken responsibility (e.g. wild animals), or institutions and officials not doing their job properly, will still feel a responsibility to compensate for that. But in some such cases the most effective altruistic action may be to create or publicly insist on the responsibility of relevant professionals and institutions rather than engage in - potentially psychologically unsustainable - patterns of self-sacrifice.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Quantification - Part 1 - An Introduction</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/78-quantification-part-1-an-introduction</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[Who was the most important person in the 20th century?

On the one hand it’s a silly question. On the other our different approaches to answering it tell us a lot about how we think about issues of great importance. I may argue that Maurice Hilleman is the most important because he is responsible for vaccines that saved more lives than anyone else. You may respond that JFK’s “we choose to go to the moon” speech is one of the defining symbols of our era. One argument is about a quantitative difference, one is a qualitative difference.

The aim of 80,000 Hours is to help people to choose careers where they can do the most good for their chosen cause. How we go about finding out what the best career is also says a lot about how we think about the things that matter. Do you want to be a great statesman with power and prestige, or do you want to be a researcher finding out ways to cure terrible diseases? And more importantly, what is the reasoning process that you use to answer that question?

How would you find out who was the best sprinter ever? Simple, go to the record books, find who ran 100m the fastest. How would you find out who is the richest person ever? Again, find out who had the most money. In these cases you can answer the question unambiguously, you can even rank people in an exact order and say how close the runners-up came.

How would you find out who the best artist ever was? Does this question even have an answer in principle? Surely not. For every person who says that Warhol is the greatest artist ever there is one who says he’s a talentless hack. Other than personal opinion there isn’t an argument that could persuade someone they were wrong about this.

How about “What career is the most effective?” What kind of question is that? Can you list careers in an exact order from best to worst? Or is it fundamentally a matter of taste? Critics of the 80,000 Hours approach argue that, like with art, it isn’t possible to simply put a numerical value on how much good a career does. And this is especially true when predicting how much good a career will do.

####What could that mean?

It could be that different careers are simply incomparable, like great art. This may be a defensible position in the abstract, but at the end of the day you must make a choice. You may claim that as a matter of principle you cannot choose between being a cancer researcher and being a trade union leader. But few people have enough time to be both. The question is how we make such a choice.

Others object that while you may be able to choose between things, in practice reducing things to numerical terms loses a lot of important information. I call Maurice Hilleman the most important person because he saved most lives but comparing vaccination with something like the Apollo project misses a huge amount of information about the significance of the two events. There is a strong point to be made here. But nonetheless, if you have a one-use-only time machine and you use it to stop Hilleman there will be more people dead than if you use it to stop JFK. That fact ought to be important, even if it does miss out a huge amount of other information.

One serious problem is when the reduction to a numerical value is difficult or impossible in practice. You cannot know how many lives will be saved by the vaccines you invent. To know that you’d have to know which vaccines would be successful. To the annoyance of inventors everywhere there is no system for finding this out in advance. In general we cannot predict with any great certainty the effect of a lot of very important things. How many lives would be saved by funding the Syrian rebels now? How much does the price of oil have to change before there is a revolution in Saudi Arabia? Nobody can know this with any great accuracy. And yet, so long as we are honest about how uncertain we are [estimating gives the best information we can have](http://80000hours.org/blog/4-estimation-is-the-best-we-have) and any alternative way of thinking about things can only do better by rare fluke.

Some of these criticisms don’t quite hold. But there are some real dangers to quantitative approaches, these will be discussed in the next post. It is important to take these criticisms very seriously. Ultimately, as I will argue in my last post, we will reliably do better in a very wide range of situations by analysing things quantitatively.

Over half of the responders on the thread noted a glaring lacuna in information available within the Effective Altruism movement – an evaluation of the best ways to do good within the cause of non-human animals. 

Among the goals of 80,000 hours is to provide resources to our community on the issues that matter most to us. As a result, we took the initiative to launch a new web-page dedicated to Effective Animal Activism: [http://effectiveanimalactivism.org/](http://effectiveanimalactivism.org/), as a part of 80,000 hours, for our members to research, share, and act upon the most effective forms of giving our time or money to help animals. 

All 80,000 hours members have pledged to use the time or resources we give effectively to help others. In pursuit of this goal, members are involved in a variety of causes, such as raising money for malaria nets – a highly effective, evidence-based way to fight global poverty. Some of our members are interested in exploring other options for doing a lot of good. The animal cause is [one such area](http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/why-aa), mostly because of the magnitudes involved. A staggering 60 billion non-human land animals (1) are killed every year for food alone. A large proportion of those animals are factory farmed, living in extreme suffering. Luckily, it turns out there are some very effective ways to reduce this suffering: for example, promoting reduction in animal-product consumption is a very cheap and highly-effective means of saving a large number of animals from suffering on factory farms. So we believe reducing animal suffering deserves further investigation as a cause for effective altruists.
 
EAA was launched for this purpose: investigate the best ways to help non-human animals and provide a forum for the community to discuss these issues with one another. And similarly to developing world charities, our research has found that by giving to some charities over others we can do hundreds or even thousands of times more good in reducing animal suffering.

Among the resources we offer are:

* [Charity evaluation](http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/Evaluation), including top charity recommendations, and thorough analysis of other candidates.
* [Career Paths](http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/careers) to help animals. Advice, information, and opportunities to network with and receive mentorship from other 80,000 hours members who are further along in their careers.
* [Optimal volunteering](http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/resources/volunteering-opportunities) opportunities with top charities.
* A blog featuring new Effective Altruism content relating to the animal cause.
* Further [resources](http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/resources) and results of our original research on effective giving to animals.
* A [community forum](http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/forums/general-discussion) to discuss all of the above.

We hope you visit the project and join our community!

Thanks for your comment! If you look at a previous blog post:
http://80000hours.org/blog/19-practical-ethics-given-moral-uncertainty
We have some important considerations to take into account if, as you say, it may be that we have further ethical obligations to animals beyond reducing their suffering. 
Although in theory taking this into account may lead to divergent practical conclusions, as you point out it seems that at the moment, our recommendations of charities and careers are likely to hold equally for both approaches (given most plausible accounts of rights), since work to reduce suffering on factory farms is also work to reduce the infringement of the rights of the individual animals on those farms.
EAA certainly aims to accommodate these considerations, and while reducing suffering seems to be an important metric under every plausible ethical viewpoint, we do intend to make clear and take into account when considerations along the lines that you suggest have important implications for substantive practical conclusions.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>481</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>ion</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>1@2.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-08-18 12:48:56</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The site name uses the general term "animal activism" and talk of "animal charity" but your criterium is the narrowed "reduced suffering".

That’s an understatement. It might therefore be surprising to think of a career as a philosopher as a potentially high impact ethical career - the sort of career that enables one to do a huge amount of good in the world. But I don’t think that philosophy’s impracticality is in the nature of the subject-matter. In fact, I think that research within certain areas of philosophy is among some of the most important and practical research that one can do. This shouldn’t be surprising when one considers that philosophy is the only subject that addresses directly the fundamental practical question: what ought I to do?
 
In this post I’ll focus in on normative ethics, practical ethics, and decision theory. Within these areas, I’m going to give a recipe for choosing research topics, if one wants to maximise the practical importance of one’s work as a philosopher. Here it goes:

1. Begin by asking 'which issues might conceivably be the most important moral issue that we currently face?'
2. Then ask ‘what are the crucial normative considerations for determining which of these issues really is the most important?'
3. Then figure out which of these crucial considerations is most likely to produce an action-relevant outcome given your marginal research time?
4. Then work on that topic!

That was the outline. It’s by no means a perfect methodology, and there are many ways in which it could be expanded upon. Its main point is to give one the gist, and hopefully to make one wonder about why research topics within ethics aren’t typically chosen in the above way. In the rest of the post I’ll briefly flesh out these different steps.
 
**1. What’s the list of the conceivably most important current moral issues?

There are many problems in the world, and there are many ways of carving up the space of ‘problems’. I’ll talk about these issues in a later post. But, in the mean time, here are a few contenders:

i. Global poverty

_Why?_ 

Currently 1.4 billion people live on less than $1.25 a day, purchasing power parity adjusted (that is: they consume fewer goods than $1.25 could buy in the US in 2005). 18 million people die per year of poverty-related causes - that’s about one third of all human deaths.
 
ii. Abortion

_Why?_ 

Around 42 million abortions are performed per year. Many people think that a fetus has similar rights to an adult person, in which case performing an abortion would be roughly on a par, morally, with murder. To get a sense of scale on this issue, consider that if this were true then the murder toll from the government sanction of abortions would outstrip all previous genocides combined.
 
iii. Animal suffering and slaughter

_Why?_ 

A staggering 50 billion non-human land animals are killed every year for food. A large proportion of those animals are factory farmed, living in extreme suffering. There are compelling arguments to the conclusion that we should treat non-human animal suffering as being on a par, morally, as human animal suffering. If this were true, then the annual animal suffering caused by humans could easily outweigh all human suffering.
 
iv. The risk of human extinction

_Why?_ 

The number of people who might live in the future, if we survive the next few centuries, numbers in the trillions (consider that, if humans live at current population levels for the average lifespan of a mammalian species, then there are over 10^13 (or ten trillion) humans in the future). If we ought, morally, to value potential future people in the same way that we value present people, then the loss from the human race going extinct in the near future might number in the trillions of lives.
 
**2. What are the crucial normative considerations?

It would be controversial to claim, of any of the above issues, that it is the most important moral issue that we face. Even if we knew all the empirical facts, there would still remain tricky moral issues – moral considerations that are crucial insofar as, if we knew the right opinion on the matter, we could write off certain of the above issues as not of the greatest importance.
 
There are many we could put on the list. But the list would certainly include: 

* How should we value future people, and merely possible people, compared with present people? (Relevant to abortion, animal suffering, extinction risk)

* What moral status do non-human animals have, and how should we make inter-species comparisons of wellbeing? (Relevant to animal suffering)

* At what stage does a human fetus become a person, with rights to life similar to that of an adult? (Relevant to abortion)

* How should we act under empirical uncertainty – in particular should we follow expected utility even when it comes to tiny probabilities of huge amounts of value? (Relevant to extinction risk)

* All other things being equal, should we prioritise the prevention of wrongs over the alleviation of naturally caused suffering? (Relevant to abortion, animal suffering)

* Given that we aren’t ever going to be certain in answers to the above questions, how should we take into account uncertainty about these moral issues in our decision-making? (Relevant to: global poverty, abortion, animal suffering, extinction risk)

 
**3. Which topic would be advanced the most from one’s marginal research time?

This one is more dependent on one’s own abilities and interests. But, in general, we could suppose that research time on a particular topic has diminishing marginal value. So, for example, working on the question of when a fetus becomes a person probably isn’t the area when one will have greatest marginal research impact: the subject has been extensively studied by hundreds of good thinkers. In contrast, the topics of how to handle moral uncertainty, or how to make inter-species wellbeing comparisons, or whether to prioritise averting wrongs over preventing naturally caused suffering, have been comparatively rarely studied.

I agree with other commenters that the highest value for philosophers like Singer has been to popularize rather than to do novel research. Also, as Zander said, some people feel some of these questions are already solved. (I have pretty firm opinions on most of them.)

One question we might add to the list is to more generally understand what types of minds are sentient in the sense of having morally relevant emotions. This applies to the question of whether insects can suffer, as well as to various types of in silico minds that we may build in the next centuries.

Quibble: The number of people killed by governments in the 20th century was over 100 million (http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/total4.doc). This is more than 42 million abortions per year, although added up over all years, abortions clearly preponderate.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>333</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Luke Muehlhauser</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>lukeprog@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/luke-muehlhauser</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-05-10 23:56:54</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks; I've been slowly developing a paper called "High Impact Philosophy." :)]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>334</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Patrick Brinich-Langlois</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>pbrinichlanglois@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/patrick-brinich-langlois</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-05-11 17:05:38</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Abortion doesn't get talked about much around here, but if anybody who's reading this thinks it's the best cause, the best way of reducing abortions is probably through funding developing-world contraception, not developed-world advocacy.

Again it's been addressed by 100s (probably + a few zeros) of philosophers, but solving the question might have such a profound effect that it's worth the relatively tiny chance of success. Having said that, it does seem like various related organisations have been making inroads on a lot of these problems without having solved the above question, so maybe the chance of success is too low - or the payoff is.

On the latter point, it's not obvious that the main value lies in 'solving' these issues. After all, many people would argue that some or all of them are already solved, and that the majority of people simply haven't understood the solution. So while it might rankle philosophers, they might do better to think of the primary challenge of persuading people toward the most *likely* answers to the above issues rather than trying to look for a perfect solution/proof for them. 

This basically seems to be where Peter Singer, Toby and you have had the most profound impact - not in advancing the dialogue of professional philosophers, but in persuading non-philosophers of the most important conclusions that (some) philosophers had already reached.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>328</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Eitan</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>ilan.fischer@yale.edu</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-05-08 23:14:47</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA["How should we value future people, and merely possible people, compared with present people?

I have one comment though. Shouldn't it, for each of the issues, at first be considerered an open question if working as a philosopher would do more good on that issue, compared to some alternative line of work. All the topics you mentioned already have a large number of philosophers at work and at least many core types of arguments have been uncovered. Wouldn't a life spent as (one more) vegan outreach flyer activist do more good for animals than a life spent as (one more) philosopher? We must also keep in mind that it is possible for someone to engage with philosophical issues and arguments as an activist without pursuing a career in philosophy.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>338</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Brian Tomasik</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>brian.tomasik@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/brian-tomasik</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-05-12 22:40:51</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks, Will.

Again, "high impact" in is meant to be a logically attributive adjective, not a logically predicative adjective.  Being a big mouse doesn't mean that you're a mouse and you're big, and, as I meant it, being a high impact philosopher doesn't mean that you're a philosopher and you're high impact.  It might be that no philosophers are high impact.  (But Nick's right: Note how influential folks like Singer, Bostrom and Ord have been on altruistically motivated people.  They're the working model.)

To keep you all in the loop, I'm planning to write 3 follow-on blog posts:
1. What are the most important unsolved moral problems?
2. How to be a high impact philosopher, part 2 - describing another way of filtering for important research questions. 
3. Can philosophy be a high impact ethical career?

But one further question that may be worth thinking about is the connection between research progress and moral progress. The people who make the most important decisions on these topics may care little about what philosophers have to say about them; if so, the marginal impact of your work seems small. 

In other words, the fact that philosophers discuss the practical question, "What ought I to do?" does not (on its own) make philosophy a practical career. We should try to figure out how philosophers can maximize their impact by translating research progress into moral progress -- through teaching, political influence, media attention, and pollination into other fields. And it's also worth thinking about the extent to which consensus among philosophers is key to achieving moral progress, and how likely philosophers are to reach consensus on some of these questions. ]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>337</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>William MacAskill</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>wdcrouch@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/william-macaskill</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-05-11 22:46:24</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey, awesome!  So many good responses!  Two important questions to distinguish are:
1. Within philosophical research, what's the most important work you could be doing?
2. Should you do philosophical research versus other things?

My post was really meant to be just about the former, but - as Jake, Brian, Martin and Zander have noticed! -  the latter is really the more important question (though they are to an extent related - if there aren't any extremely important questions to solve, then philosophy is a no-hoper).  Now that I think about it, it makes sense for me to write a post on the latter question too, given the amount I've thought about the issue!!

I've also got much more to say on what I think are the most important unsolved problems in philosophy (a question I've worked on with Nick Beckstead), which Zander and Brian (and I'm sure Luke) wanted to add to.  Would people like to see a post on that too?

Thanks again!

But I got away from it when I realized applied ethicisits/philosophers don't have much new to say on topics like whether free trade is going to help the poor, or how foreign aid should be allocated, how to lobby effectively for more AIDS funding, or anything that seems relevant. Economists study most of those questions, political scientists can weigh in on some, and in general it seems the only way to answer any of those questions is using the scientific method. Sometimes I'm blown away by what philosophers will write without ever looking at any data or interviewing anyone or providing any evidence beyond assumptions about how the world works. 

Peter Singer is somewhat of an exception. He does look at some of the evidence but often not seriously--he doesn't understand some of the statistics used in research he cites or some of the statistical concepts like how saying "we didn't find significant evidence from an effect" is not the same as saying "there is evidence/proof that there is no effect."

So I think for abortion and poverty you'd want to learn statistics and economics (and some political sciences) to model aid will be spent and how demand and supply of abortions will be impacted by a new regulation and the like. For extinction you probably want to study a lot of physics. For animal issues maybe a mix of biology and economics/stats for an understanding of how legislation will/won't protect animals (and the unintended side effects of it) as well as understanding the animals themselves. What tools will philosophy teach you?

(I'm told philosophy will teach you "critical thinking" like realizing some jobs are "replaceable" and that you have to analyze the marginal impact of what you add as, say, a doctor, not the average impact of the profession as a whole. But economists have known about the replacability for over 100 years, we call it the opportunity cost, it is the "unseen" in Bastiats famous "seen and unseen" essay. And the "marginal revolution" in economics took place in the late 19th century. AFAIK philosopher seem to have stumbled on these ideas in the 60-70s debates on act vs rule utilitarianism but the act utilitarians using them seem to have LOST that debate before some realization they were right in the past 5-10 years.)]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>523</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Steve</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>stevewhite16@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-09-04 12:21:51</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The beginning of my comment got truncated a bit.

When I pick BLT or egg-mayo, I’m prioritising. When a small business owner decides whether to hire a new worker or install a new machine, they’re prioritising. When we decide to increase the cost of energy in order to reduce future climate change, we’re prioritising.

In fact, one of the most dramatic conflicts of the twentieth century was over how best to prioritise. Capitalists advocated a spread-out strategy, where individual choices combine to guide the priorities of entire societies. Socialists believed that a central organisation is needed to set priorities for societies.

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/14/original/ID-10051699.jpg?1345545123'><img align = "right" alt="Global prioritisation - apples and oranges. Free image courtesy of freedigitalphotos.net." class="image medium" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/14/large/ID-10051699.jpg?1345545123" /></a> Given how important prioritisation is, and how much people seem to care about doing it right, it’s startling that relatively little research is done into how best to prioritise the most important issues facing society. People do research on, say, the best ways to distribute humanitarian aid. But it wasn’t until 2004 that anyone thought to compare the best opportunities in humanitarian aid with the best opportunities in climate change adaptation technology or in reducing international trade barriers.

There are powerful reasons for avoiding the problem.

*	It’s hard to know where to start. We’d have to, for example, find some way to compare reductions in human rights abuses with reductions in child deaths. It seems unlikely we’ll ever find a rigorous way to do that.

*	It’s steeped in value judgements. No matter which way you go, you’ll have to make some ideologically loaded decisions. How much do you value unborn children? Animals? Artistic expression? Happiness? Some people will disagree with you no matter which attitude you take.

*	It is hugely complex to analyse. How much good can you do by delivering humanitarian aid to conflict zones? Well, are you going to take into account the risk that delivering aid will prolong the conflict? You really have to. But then perhaps a long conflict might be just the thing to force a whole region to take international cooperation and governance issues seriously. You can’t follow the causal chain all the way down the rabbit hole.

But none of those are good reasons. The simple truth is that we have no choice: we have to prioritise our work. Whenever any person, group or government makes any decision about how to spend or what to work on they are implicitly making these comparisons. 

And they’re doing it badly, carelessly, and unconsciously.

There are some groups working to tackle the challenge of global prioritisation. Organisations like the Disease Control Priorities Project try to engage with a specific part of the challenge. The Copenhagen Consensus has engaged lots of specialists in a broad range of fields to present the case for many types of opportunity, and has worked on comparing the best of them.

No one, though, is addressing the problem that matters most to the members of 80,000 Hours. No one, that is, until now. Over the next few months, 80,000 Hours will be putting together a rough first pass at answering the question
“Suppose I’m willing to put the next ten years of my work behind any cause there is. Which one will make the biggest difference?”

It’s not going to be perfect, or even close. It will take advantage of modern research, with all the disadvantages and question-marks that entails. It will depend on a lot of assumptions, but where possible we’ll make those assumptions clear to let you decide.
The first step, and one of the most important, is the list of challenges. Here’s where you come in. I’ve got a list I’ll post in a bit, but I don’t want to bias you. What do you think the most important challenges facing humanity are?

The jobs that get the most credit and recognition aren’t necessarily the ones that make the most difference. The smartest people might not be those who make the greatest contribution. These statements are true generally, but one area in which they might be less immediately obvious is in academic research.

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/91/original/manager_picture.jpg?1361168971'><img alt="Activist_Manager" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/91/small/manager_picture.jpg?1361168971" /></a>

There’s a general misconception that researchers are the only people who really contribute towards scientific progress. But there’s a lot of incredibly important work, besides the research itself, that’s vital to producing important research, and such work is often underappreciated. We don’t realise how important other people working in academia are: people in administration, management, or communications. Their work is crucial; they bring it all together.

We also tend to think of these people as fairly interchangeable; that it doesn’t make much difference who fills these roles, as long as the work gets done. But someone who is motivated and interested in research can potentially make a *huge* difference in these roles, as they can add a huge amount of value as compared with someone who is not. So this could potentially be an avenue for some  incredibly high impact work.

##High Impact Management

In an earlier post, we talked about the idea of the [high impact PA](http://80000hours.org/blog/54-the-high-impact-pa-how-anyone-can-bring-about-ground-breaking-research): how helping an already very effective researcher to be more productive by taking everyday tasks off their hands could arguably bring about more important research than you going into research yourself. Whilst this is a great illustration of how making a difference isn’t always a matter of what you do directly or about getting recognition, it clearly won’t suit everyone. If you’re really interested in a certain area of research it’s perfectly reasonable to feel that a job involving secretarial work and little involvement with the research itself would be unsatisfying - not to mention a waste of your talent and enthusiasm for the subject.

But it’s not a professorship, a PA job, or nothing. There’s a lot of work that research departments need doing more on the side of management and communications which involve a great deal more intellectual challenge and engagement with the research itself. Most of the ideas in this post came from a conversation I had recently with [Sean O hEigeartaigh](http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/our_staff/futuretech_staff/sean_o_heigeartaigh) who works as an Academic Project Manager at the Future of Humanity Institute in Oxford, so a great deal of the credit for them goes to him. Sean is also himself a great example of someone making a huge difference in research through indirect means. I asked him a bit about his background and how he ended up in his current position at the FHI:

*“I did a PhD in comparative genomics at Trinity College Dublin, and realised I had management abilities whilst running an arts organisation. When I finished my PhD I was choosing between doing a postdoc and the project manager role at FHI. I chose the project manager role in the end because I really believed in the importance of the work being done on the project, and it provided a niche where I could really make the most of my management and research abilities. It seemed like having both was fairly rare but could be really useful. The FHI is also somewhere that good management is particularly useful because it’s a small and rapidly growing organisation. The research conducted is also often quite unconventional, so having a project manager able to understand and communicate it sensitively is really important.”* 

##What would this involve day-to-day?

To get a better idea of what jobs in academic management really involve, I asked Sean about some of the jobs he does and that need doing on a day-to-day basis in a research institute like the FHI. The main areas seemed to be:

* Keeping track of and prioritising research within a department
* Fundraising: looking for grant opportunities, preparing grant applications, talking to and negotiating with prospective funders
* Organising and running events and conferences
* Communicating with media and policy, public speaking
* Managing budgets
* Attracting new and talented researchers to the group
* Coordinating and communicating with other research groups

Hybrid positions, combining research and management, could also be an option: it’s possible, like Sean, to publish peer-reviewed papers whilst working as a project manager in research. So if the idea of academic management appeals but you think you’d miss not doing direct research, you might be able to get the best of both worlds: having, say, 50% of the output of a typical academic researcher whilst also doing vital management and communications work.

It’s not just niche research institutes like the FHI that need project managers, though. These kinds of jobs are common and necessary in big scientific research institutes, too. For example, the European Bioinformatics Institute [recently advertised](http://www.ensembl.info/blog/2013/01/21/comparative-genomics-project-leader/) for a Project Leader on a comparative genomics project. [This Nature article](http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7312-240a) nicely summarises the need for better management in academia.

##Why could this be very high impact?

Freeing up time and improving management for a top researcher could be a way to make a big difference because you make an already effective person more effective. If you do administrative or management work for a whole research department, this effect could potentially be very large: say you’re managing a team of 10 researchers and in doing so you increase their output by just 15% each. Your indirect contribution to research output would then be 150% of what each researcher themselves contribute directly. That is, you’d be making more difference than the researchers themselves! 

But it’s much more than just freeing up time and making people more productive. There are a number of other huge advantages you can bring to a research department as a skilled and dedicated project manager:

* Communicating research to the public in a sensitive, eloquent way that enhances rather than damages it.
* Working with policy makers to help implement research where possible or necessary.
* Having someone to consider the bigger picture where individual researchers cannot, prioritising research and disentangling what’s important from what merely appears so or is interesting.
* Taking important funding opportunities academics might not have the time for.
* Helping institutes run a more diverse range of projects than they might otherwise be able to.
* Dealing with meta-issues such as the effect of areas of research on the reputation of an academic or department.
* Bringing more talented researchers into important fields who might have done less valuable work otherwise.

A key point here is when thinking about making a difference, you want to find an important job that you’ll be doing better than the person who would be doing it in your place. And it seems like there could be a huge difference between a research manager who simply puts in the hours but nothing more, and one who is willing to go the extra mile. Speaking to Sean about the difference this makes from his experience, he said:

*“There’s a really big difference between someone who does the 9-5 and goes home, and someone who feels like they’re really doing something worthwhile that’s a benefit to the world. You can get a lot more value from the latter than the former.*

*Another important point is that this is somewhere that academia is competing with the business market. The skillset needed to be a project manager in academia is roughly the same as required for a similar role in business, but the salary structure in academia is fixed. This means that it makes it harder for us to get the right calibre of person for a position like this, because they could be better paid in a corporate setting. So someone who is altruistic or motivated by research can also make a big difference simply because they’re likely to be more skilled than someone without this motivation that would be doing the job otherwise. Someone who is willing to bring the same level of skill and initiative for a lower salary at a research institute brings a huge amount of return.”*

##Who might this suit?

This kind of job is the perfect opportunity to do something incredibly important whilst working in an interesting environment surrounded by inspiring people and ideas, and provides a lot of flexibility to do different things later on. Especially if you’re interested in intellectual ideas or considering going into research but unsure if it’s right for you, it may be worth considering this as a valuable direction that your future career could branch off into.

What specific kinds of skills or characteristics do you need for this kind of work?

* An ability to prioritise
* Good time management
* An interest in and ability to understand the research being conducted
* General enthusiasm
* The ability to juggle a lot of commitments
* Reliability
* Diplomacy
* Good salesperson and communication skills

This kind of skillset is probably quite rare: but this makes it all the more valuable if you think you have it.

Having either research or management experience is likely crucial to success in an academic management role. So if this is something you’re seriously interested in, it’s probably worth either getting a PhD or some management experience (or both, if possible!) - depending on specific position, as some will put more weight on research background, others on management experience. This is also good justification for getting involved in running student societies and charitable organisation whilst at University, rather than focusing purely on books and essays. This could be a great way to pick up skills in managing groups of people and making the most of limited time and resources, as well as learning whether this kind of work might suit you.

I've grown convinced of the value of project management, such that more and more of my altruism work has moved in this direction, especially in the last year.

In general, I find that people love doing concrete things, but there aren't as many who do big-picture planning, organizing, tracking and follow-up, cross-team communication, etc. For example, I can coordinate to get a series of essays written with less time than it would take me to write them myself. Coordinating with others builds a volunteer labor pool, friendships, training, etc. that can bear further fruits later. And there are often low-hanging fruit in using the work of other groups rather than reinventing the wheel.

Also, as you say, it can be really useful for the manager to know the technical details of what's going on. In my team at Microsoft, the managers are often also some of the most technically skilled people. This background can give intuition about what projects to pursue and how to guide others in the right directions.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Why don't charities spend more on fundraising?</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/92-why-don-t-charities-spend-more-on-fundraising</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[</br>

People often think it’s bad for their charity of choice to spend money fundraising. Up there with percentage spent on administration, people want the portion of the budget spent fundraising to be low (1).

This has always been a mystery to me. If a charity can use your money to go out and raise even more money, that’s great! They’ve just multiplied the impact of your donation.

An even greater mystery has been why charities don’t spend *even more* on fundraising. The returns from fundraising seem to be huge. For each £1 spent on fundraising, studies have shown that charities typically raise £4-10 (2). That’s an incredible 300-900% return. Why wouldn’t they do as much of this as possible?

One theory is that the social norm against heavy fundraising prevents them from doing as much as they would like. This may be part of the reason. It looks like the sector, and in particular the most effective charities, might under-fundraise. But it also seems that charities are taking most of the easy fundraising opportunities already out there, and so are behaving more effectively than it first looks.

* * *

Although the *average* returns to fundraising are high, it looks like the returns from *additional* fundraising are much lower. We can show this with a very rough calculation:

* In 2006, charities in the UK raised an estimated £27bn from fundraising (3). They spent about £5.7bn on fundraising (4)

* In 2010, charities raised £31bn (5). They spent £7.8bn on fundraising (6). (inflation-adjusted) 

* So, over this time, an *extra* £2.1bn was spent on fundraising, raising an extra £4bn. If you assume the extra fundraising led to this increase, then it made a profit of £1.9bn - a return of 90% (7) (8).

</br>

So, although *on average* fundraising gives you up to a 900% return, *extra* fundraising over and above what's already being doing may give you much, much less. So according to this very rough analysis (7),  the charity sector is already taking almost all of its best opportunities to encourage the public to give. This is what as we'd expect if charities are trying to effectively promote their cause. If easy opportunities were left lying around, then someone would take them, use the money to fundraise even more, and soon these opportunities would be gone. It also agrees with our experience of most people having a 'charity budget'. Once they've made a bunch of donations, they stop giving when asked again.

Fundraising is risky (you’re never sure how much you’re going to raise), so individual charities won’t want to fundraise until they make zero returns. Making a loss fundraising would be a disaster for most charities. It’s also clear that if charities start to fundraise too heavily, then it could end in destructive competition. So there’s good reason to be cautious about extra fundraising.

On the other hand, if the 90% figure is at all accurate, it’s still a pretty fat margin of error. So, the charity sector is perhaps still not fundraising enough. We cause this to happen by evaluating charities on what percentage of their budget they spend fundraising, and encouraging them to keep it low. This seems like it could easily cost the charity sector several billion pounds per year. If the average charity is doing good work, then a lot of value is being lost. (9)(10)

So, although there might be some room for charities to fundraise more, they're already taking the best opportunities. This has some interesting implications. One is explored in my next post. Another is that if we really want to encourage the public to give more, we need new approaches. We hope that 80,000 Hours and [Giving What We Can](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org) are one kind of new approach. By encouraging people to give a big chunk of their income, we’re raising the overall level of giving. What other ideas do you have?

(1) For instance, see this Guardian article which shows you how to check your favourite charity’s fundraising ratio: http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2005/oct/21/voluntarysector.charitablegiving

Indeed, the assumption that donors dislike low funding ratios (i.e. a high proportion of the budget spent on fundraising) has been incorporated in economic models of charity fundraising, for instance:

Rose-Ackerman, S. (1982). *“Charitable giving and “excessive” fundraising”*. Quarterly Journal of Economics
97, 195–212.

(2) CAF found that the ratio of voluntary income to expenditures on fundraising over all charities in the UK was about 10x in 2010. This is based on accounting data, so doesn’t suffer from limited sampling problems. However, since charities seem to aim to keep the portion of expenses that are counted as fundraising low, it’s likely to overestimate the true returns on fundraising.
Charities Aid Foundation, (11 July 2011), * “The cost of fundraising”
The Institute of Fundraising’s 2010 survey shows that the ratio of voluntary income to expenditures is about 4x.

I think the reason for the discrepancy is that the CAF study includes all charities, whereas the IoF report is focused on larger charities. I’d welcome more info on this though.

(3) Total charity income taken from:
CAF’s Charity Trends Report, Key Charts
http://www.charitytrends.org/KeyCharts.aspx

Proportion of voluntary income (income from voluntary sources) of 55% taken from the Institute of Fundraising’s 2006 survey of about 40 charities.
http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/research/fundratios/

(4) Inferred from the IoP’s survey finding of a 4.4x fundraising multiple in 2006.

(5) Total charity income taken from CAF as above. Proportion of voluntary income of 59% taken from the IoF’s 2010 survey, source as before. Inflation adjustment of 0.89x, estimated from this inflation data:
http://www.rateinflation.com/inflation-rate/uk-historical-inflation-rate

(6) Using IoF’s finding of a fundraising multiple of 4x in 2010.

(7) This analysis is clearly pretty rough. Ideally, it can be completed in several countries, over multiple time-frames. The data, however, is difficult to come by, so doing a more sophisticated analysis would be a significant undertaking. One confounding factor is that fundraising will be more profitable during times of economic growth. To partially counteract this, I’ve used a 4 year period, approximating corresponding to two growth periods in the economic cycle (comparing 2006 to 2009 would depress the figures, because the recession in 2009 made fundraising particularly tough).

One supporting factor is that there has been a steady downwards trend in fundraising ratios over the last ten years from 5.5 to 4, so it doesn’t look like finding diminishing marginal returns over this period was due to random noise, or an artifact of the period 2006-2010. It seems like 10-20 years ago charities were not doing enough fundraising, but they have become more rational over this period. Over the last decade, they were successful in raising the overall proportion of income given to charity from 0.9% of GDP to 1.1%. But it seems like it won’t be possible to raise this much further without new approaches or a social shift.

(8) You'd also want to adjust growth in charitable giving for GDP growth, since we'd expect charitable giving to rise naturally with wealth. GDP growth in the UK over this period, however, was about zero. So, we don't need to make an extra calculation.

(9) We're also not sure how steep the decline in the returns from fundraising is at the margin. If it's very steep, then the capacity for extra fundraising before you drop from 90% returns to zero could be very low.

(10) The social norm against fundraising is stronger than it looks from this data. I've calculated the returns from marginal fundraising to the charity sector as a whole. But consider the point of view of each individual charity. When charities fundraise, some of the money raised is money that would have been given to other charities. So the individual fundraising efforts will look like they're creating more money for the charity sector than they actually are. Since (in our experience) most charities don't explicitly take into account the fact that some of their donations are at the expense of other charities, they'll have an incentive to fundraise to the point that the overall charity sector is *making a loss.* This is the positive side of the norm against excessive fundraising. It prevents charities from getting into a competition for resources that makes them worse off overall.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>\</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2012-10-09 21:21:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>590</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Benjamin Todd</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>benjamin.john.todd@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/benjamin-todd</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-10-11 17:25:32</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Ruairi, yes my figure is for the fundraising of all charities taken together.

Is it not an option that some large % of total donations happen as a result of a very small amount of fund-raising and the major function of the remainder simply re-directs it? (in charitable geography but also in time) if people's perceived 'charity budgets' are spread over a number of years then you would see an increase in donations in a year with more fundraising whether or not there was a net increase.

I sometimes consider whether fundraising as a whole has been a net gain. After two decades of constant exposure I have certainly developed  an almost complete emotional inoculation to seeing people starving and a near in-penetrable set of solicitation-defence habits. I've even heard a number of people from London say that they actually now hate charity due to its predatory  attacking them on the street (there are a lot of chuggers in London)

This said, its likely only due to this 'inoculation' that I didn't feel uncomfortable addressing ethical effectiveness questions in the first place (I also observe a correlation between people who are 'less inoculated' and people who really don't like effectiveness conversation)

Something that has had me excited recently are opportunities for nonprofits to generate funding in ways that perhaps rely more heavily on the demands of consumers for goods and services than altruism (e.g., non-profit bottled water producers, such as NIKA, that donate 100% of their profits to improving the quality of drinking water in developing countries).  Another exciting example of this is Tickets For Charity, a for-profit social enterprise in the United States that buys high-demand tickets directly from artists and sports teams at face value, sells the tickets at a price above face value (as determined by demand on the resale market--which is legal in the US), and donates the profit (minus a service charge) to charities selected by both the ticket purchaser and the ticket supplier (unfortunately many of the charities that are chosen are not necessarily high impact ones, but that’s another story).]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>889</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Brian Tomasik</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>brian.tomasik@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/brian-tomasik</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-02-17 22:38:21</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great discussion! Even if charities do mainly steal from one another, it remains the case that good charities may want to do a lot of fundraising to steal from the less good ones, at least unless the competitive dynamic changes. I agree that creating a movement targeted at increasing total giving rather than giving more to a particular cause could be useful.

I think there's also a question about what kinds of fundraising to do. Mass mailings may indeed turn people away, and the same for street fundraisers, but maybe more strategic, relationship-building fundraisers who cultivate friendships with high-net-worth donors is a different ballgame. This doesn't necessarily leave a negative impression on the public (indeed, most of the public won't see it).

I'm scared of attempts to put fundraising into commercial products because people might think "if I spend $1 on buying a gift that's partly directed toward a charity, I don't have to donate $1 to that charity anymore," when in fact this reduces total donations. Whether this actually happens is a question for further study, but I would want to be careful before allowing people to feel good about buying products they don't need.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Beyond Meat™ vs. New Harvest: Does Beyond Meat™ make New Harvest obsolete?</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/71-beyond-meat-vs-new-harvest-does-beyond-meat-make-new-harvest-obsolete</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[[New Harvest](http://www.new-harvest.org/) is a charity that may have the potential to make a huge difference. It provides grant-support for research into the development of meat substitutes, in particular – [in vitro meat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_meat). Once cheap in vitro meat is developed, the suffering of the 60 billion farm animals raised on factory farms each year will end. In theory, bringing this day forward by even one hour could conservatively mean preventing 1 million years of [animal suffering on factory farms](http://meatvideo.com/). 

A number of Effective Altruists (EAs) as well as large groups in the animal movement think this pursuit could be a highly cost-effective way to end the suffering on factory farms. For example, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) recently [extended](http://www.peta.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/2012/06/25/in-vitro-meat-prize-deadline-extended.aspx) its $1 million contest for the first marketable in vitro meat. Many activists, exasperated with their unsuccessful experiences at changing the minds of people around them, turn to New Harvest in the belief that absent chemically-identical products at cheaper prices, the public could never be stopped from eating the products of factory-farmed animals.
As altruists concerned about most effectively reducing suffering, does New Harvest then merit our financial support, as an optimal charity to bring about an end to factory farms? I argue not.

[Beyond Meat™](http://beyondmeat.com/) is a new company that released its products to market this year. Using research by scientists Fu-hung Hsieh and Harold Huff at the University of Missouri, it has developed a product made of purely plant-based ingredients that mimics chicken to such a degree that renowned New York Times food journalist and author Mark Bittman claimed that it *“[fooled me badly in a blind tasting](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/opinion/sunday/finally-fake-chicken-worth-eating.html)”*. Recently covered by [Time Magazine](http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/07/30/meat-for-the-meatless-fake-chicken-gets-so-real-its-freaky/), [Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/07/beyond_meat_fake_chicken_that_tastes_so_real_it_will_freak_you_out_.html), and [NPR](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/05/17/152519988/a-farmer-bets-better-fake-chicken-meat-will-be-as-good-as-the-real-thing), Beyond Meat is spreading quickly, costs no more than organic chicken, is full of protein and iron, and contains far less fat and no cholesterol in comparison with the animal-product. As demand grows and production scales, there is good reason to expect its price to drop to that of regular chicken. At that time we’ll have a product whose every discernible physical property is virtually identical to chicken. This makes me wonder: why spend millions of dollars and several more decades trying to grow chicken in a lab?

Well, one might argue that the public will never choose a plant-based alternative over ‘the real thing’. However, this seems doubtful – presented with two virtually identical choices in terms of taste and texture, one healthier, and the other made of animal flesh produced synthetically in a lab, how many people are likely to choose the latter?

In contrast to Beyond Meat™, in-vitro meats are likely still a long way from being commercially viable, both in terms of inexpensive scale production and taste/texture. Currently, the growth solution that is used is extremely expensive and, barring some revolutionary innovations, it is likely to stay that way for a while. It'll also take years of refinement before these meats are indistinguishable from the real thing. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, lab-grown meat presents a large consumer hurdle because of the “yuck” factor in the public’s reaction to synthetic lab-grown life.

Regardless of whether in-vitro meat or plant-based alternatives are what will ultimately replace factory-farmed chicken, the best way to promote these products will be to create demand for them. [Effective Animal Activism](http://effectiveanimalactivism.org/) (80,000 Hours’ [new members project](http://80000hours.org/blog/70-project-launch-effective-animal-activism)) has found that its [top recommended charities](http://effectiveanimalactivism.org/top-charities) undertake precisely this activity. For the activists referred to earlier who point to slow progress in this domain: in the course of the last four years of the previous decade, US college populations experienced a 100% rise in veganism and a 50% rise in vegetarianism ([1% to 2% and 8% to 12%, respectively](http://www.mfablog.org/2010/10/vegnism-a-growing-trend-among-college-students.html)). Concurrently, meat consumption has [declined 12.2% over the past 5 years]( http://whyveganoutreach.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/graph-number-one-revisited.html). These organizations, in addition to reducing the numbers of animals suffering in factory farms, inculcate long-term ideological concern for animal suffering among the public. This added benefit will likely eventually translate into concern for other domains of animal suffering, including experimentation, clothing, entertainment, and [wild animals](http://effectiveanimalactivism.org/wild). In contrast, the technological fix that New Harvest would facilitate produces comparatively less benefit in terms of the spreading of concern for animals.

In light of these considerations, it’s doubtful that New Harvest represents the best long-term approach to reducing animal suffering. While New Harvest probably does a lot of good, we should not rely on it to be the sole cause of the end of factory farming. Activists who sit by idly awaiting the future arrival of the messiah in the form of in-vitro meat need to simply look around and realize that fake meat is already here - the time is now! The presence of Beyond Meat™ makes it a matter of increasing demand and reducing supply costs until animal agriculture becomes obsolete. Activities which accelerate and facilitate this are likely to be our best bets for reducing the greatest animal suffering in the most cost-effective manner.

JUST IN!: Gaverick Matheny, founder of New Harvest, has posted this reply on the EAA blog:

***

"Thanks for starting a discussion of supply vs demand side interventions for animal welfare. A few counterpoints:

1. New Harvest works on advancing plant-based meat substitutes, too. We recently sponsored symposia at AAAS and IFT on meat substitutes that featured Beyond Meat's Ethan Brown, and Sand Hill Foods' Pat Brown. Fu-hung Hsieh has been on New Harvest's board since 2005. I think the meat substitute market needs to be diverse to succeed. Just as we need a combination of energy alternatives to replace fossil fuels, I think we'll need a combination of plant, mycoprotein, and cultured animal proteins to replace meat. I don't think every omnivore will be willing to eat a single soy-based meat substitute.

2. I don't think current plant-based meat substitutes have reached their optimum. They're getting much better but are still not able to fool most meat eaters, unless served as an ingredient so their texture is masked. I haven't seen their prices drop to be competitive with conventional meat, even as their market share has increased. Future improvements are likely, given the small amount of R&D that's been done to date. I think it is cost-effective to invest in further R&D at Beyond Meat, Sand Hill Farms, and other substitute R&D, such as Beyond Eggs / Hampton Creek Foods.

3. Bon Appetit survey: a 4 percentage point increase in veg college students is 800k people. That would account for only 2% (0.3 percentage points) of the decrease in per capita meat consumption observed over the last five years. I would guess that most of the decrease is due to meat eaters eating less meat, not going veg. I think that encouraging vegetarianism can be very cost-effective, and may well be more cost-effective than supply-side interventions, but the argument would require other evidence."

Soy, especially non-fermented, contains substances which some claim to be harmful, such as phytates or phytic acid (which may block the absorption of certain minerals such as iron, calcium, magnesium, and zinc, but also toxic ones such as mercury and lead), goitrogens, oxalic acid, hemagglutinin, trypsin inhibitors (which decrease the absorption of some aminoacids and could cause overwork for the pancreas). Soy protein isolate may have high levels of aluminum, nitrites (possible carcinogens), and lysinoalanine (a toxin). Soy may stimulate TSH production (increasing risk of hypothiroidism). Tofu intake was associated with worse memory and brain atrophy in some studies (though this doesn't apply to fermented soy products such as tempeh).

Apparently formalin is used in some Asian countries, including Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Pakistan, India, China (though not in Hong Kong), to conserve various types of food, including tofu, fish, chicken, noodles, and beer, what makes one wonder if the controls in that study weren't eating similar amounts of formalin from other sources as well. Website soyfoods.org claims that the Japanese study had technical flaws, but this site may be biased. These are the studies I found on Pubmed about soy's effects on cognition (I should have done a comprehensive research before posting those two studies, although in practice it is quite time-consuming to do a comprehensive research on the literature before posting results of any studies, hence results of studies should always be taken with some caution).

This study found no effect with after a 7 day consumption of soybeans.

The increases in cognition appear to be hormone-related.

Want to make the most different that you can?
Become a banker. An ethical banker.

<img alt="Will MacAskill" class="shadow float-right" src="/assets/blog/willcrouch.png">
Not what you expected? Research on professional philanthropy by an Oxford
University ethicist today reveals a new way of looking at ethical careers.
Believe it or not, it is possible to be an ethical banker. William MacAskill
today discusses his research at the Uehiro Centre in Oxford University's
Philosophy Faculty with Ian Hislop on the Today Programme at 8:45am.

MacAskill is launching 80,000 Hours: an organisation which is redefining
ethical careers. Incredibly an individual typically spends 80,000 hours on
their career: choosing a career which maximises the difference you can make
is therefore paramount for those considering an ethical career.

<img alt="Ian Hislop" class="shadow float-right" src="/assets/blog/hislop.png">
Professional philanthropy - deliberately pursuing a lucrative career in order
to donate a substantial proportion of earnings to the best causes - may have
significantly more impact than careers traditionally considered as ethical.
Let us take the example of a banker and a charity worker: firstly consider
the financial discrepancy in earnings – the money that a banker donates can
pay for several charity workers who would be better qualified to do the job.

Secondly, money is fungible and can be moved to better causes as they come
along whereas experience as a charity worker is specific and often
non-transferable.  Thirdly, the charity worker would replace a similar charity
worker but the ethical banker would replace a banker who would probably keep
all his money to himself.  This means the ethical banker would make a
difference which would not have occurred without his choosing professional
philanthropy.

These factors mean that the “direct benefit a single aid worker can produce
is limited, whereas the philanthropic banker's donations might indirectly
help ten times as many people.”

<img alt="Today programme" class="shadow float-right" src="/assets/blog/todayprog.png">
Ian Hislop’s programme When Bankers Were Good is aired tonight on BBC 2 at
9pm and looks at the philanthropic pursuits of Victorian bankers. In an
interview with the Telegraph Hislop comments: “People were greedy then but
there was at least a culture of religious or humanist figures at the heart of
banking who thought they should be doing things better that seems to be a
model which we don’t now have.”

Tune into William MacAskill’s and Ian Hislop’s discussion on the Today Programme
at 8:45am to hear more about why spending your 80,000 hours conducting
professional philanthropy is ethical preferable to traditional ethical
careers.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier></dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2011-11-22 19:02:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status></item><item><title>How to be a high impact philosopher, part II</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/98-how-to-be-a-high-impact-philosopher-part-ii</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/34/original/IvoryTower.jpg?1348782962'><img align="right" alt="Ivory Tower" class="image small" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/34/small/IvoryTower.jpg?1348782962" /></a> 

In a [previous post](http://80000hours.org/blog/46-how-to-be-a-high-impact-philosopher), I discussed how, as a philosopher, one should decide on a research area.  I suggested that one method was to work out what are potentially the biggest problems the world faces, work out what the crucial normative consideration are, and then work on those areas.  Call that the top-down method: starting with the problem, and working backwards to the actions one should take.

There’s a second method for high impact philosophy, however.  Let’s call it the bottom-up method.

Begin by asking ‘which are the biggest decisions that one typically makes in life?’
Then ask: ‘What are the crucial normative considerations that might affect how I should make those decisions?’
Then figure out which of these crucial considerations is most likely to produce an action-relevant outcome given your marginal research time.
Then work on that topic!
As in my previous post, I’ll go through each step in turn.
 
1) **What are the biggest decisions one typically makes in life?**

By ‘biggest decisions’ I mean the decisions that potentially have the greatest positive or negative moral impact.  In general, these will be those decisions that involve the greatest amount of resources – where having greater ‘resources’ is just the power to make things happen.
So what are the biggest decisions one typically makes in life?  The list would certainly include the following:
 
i. How should I spend my money?
Why?
Over a lifetime, a high school graduate can expect to earn [$1.2million](http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/moneymatters/a/edandearnings.htm).  With a bachelor’s degree, that figure almost doubles to $2.1 million; with a professional degree that number doubles again, to $4.4 million.  Considered over a lifetime, almost every person reading this blog is a millionaire. 
 
ii. What career should I choose?
Why?
A typical lifetime career involves over 80,000 hours of work – that’s more time than we’ll spend on any other activity, except sleeping.
 
 
2) **What are the crucial normative questions?**

There are some questions that have analogues for both (i) and (ii).  For instance:

Should I just spend my money/time wherever it has greatest current expected benefit? What are the conditions under which I should:

* Invest my money (e.g. in an index fund) or time (e.g. getting a degree) so that I generate a bigger payoff later?

* Use my money/time to fund/do research into how best to spend my money/time?

* Use my money/time to fund/do research into how best to invest my money/time?

 
There are also subtle concepts that are relevant to both.  For example:

* Replaceability: Sometimes, if I don’t work for an organisation, someone else will take my place.

* Similarly, sometimes, if I don’t donate to a charity, then someone else will do so instead, and they’ll fill their room for more funding anyway.

* Compensation: if we remove one doctor from the NHS, then all the other doctors in the NHS will compensate: they’ll stop doing the least important tasks, and do the more important tasks that that one doctor would have done.  So the benefit from a marginal (that is, one additional) doctor is far smaller than the average benefit from all doctors.

* Similarly, I should expect that charities do the most cost-effective interventions first, and so the benefit from a marginal dollar will be less than the average benefit from the charity’s expenditure.

 
And there are questions to do with the interaction between these two issues:

* How should I value my time, in monetary terms?  Under what conditions should I turn time into money, and vice versa?

 
3) **Which topics would be advanced the most from one’s marginal research time?**

Again, a good heuristic is to look at which topics are the least well-studied.
The question of ‘giving now vs giving later’ has had only one academic article written about it: interestingly, people tend to find the idea that one should save and give later on, even though we’re perfectly happy with the idea that one should invest time in oneself (e.g. by getting a degree) in order to have greater influence later on, and we’re perfectly happy with the idea that, for self-interested reasons, one should save one’s money now, in order to consume more later on.
The question of how much we should discount future time and money has been extensively discussed by economists; but not, to my knowledge, in the condition where one’s principal aim is to benefit others (rather than oneself). 
I don’t know of any in-depth philosophical discussions of replaceability or compensation effects.
 
So, though the top-down approach has had very little attention within philosophy, the bottom up approach, to my knowledge, has had basically none.  This is remarkable, given the ubiquity and importance of the questions.  One possible explanation is practical ethics’ obsession with developments in biomedical science; another might be that so many of the issues often blur with economics, so it’s difficult for non-specialists to contribute.   But, finally, it’s worth considering that ethical scrutiny of career choice and our spending habits is radical, in terms of its potential impact on our lives, in a way that discussions of the wrongness of stealing or of cloning typically aren't.  And it can be difficult to write on issues that can so greatly affect how one ought to spend one’s time (especially when the conclusion might be that one should stop being a philosopher).

I suggest this not due to selfish considerations, or some moral imperative not to be entirely selfless, but because I believe it is very, very, very difficult to sustain a life of giving for a long period of time. It is, in fact, as valuable as it is hard. 

If all one considers is how much positive impact they can have on the world, the effect will be burnout, which severely reduces the chances of attaining positive impact. Therefor, future planning must take into consideration the problem of keeping ourselves motivated and hard working. Although I am a non-believer, I think it is possible to take a cue from religion on this front. More related to the topic at hand is the idea that one must consider how rewarding and interesting one finds the career path he or she intends to embark on. It cannot all be about how much good one does for others.

In short, a balance between what I want (and have the ability to do well), and what is needed, should be struck. It is  a select few who can be entirely selfless, and usually they have trained themselves long and hard to attain that state of mind. The rest of us must be careful...]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>562</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Kacper Kowalczyk</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>kacperpkowalczyk@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-10-01 17:37:07</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[About discounting future time and money: Recently, there has been a debate in the literature on climate change about the appropriate discount rate (see, e.g., Dasgupta, Nordhaus, Weitzman).

When we talk about giving to charities there’s a dirty secret we try really hard not to mention. Some charities are “bad”.

When people look at charities, all of which are doing decent things, they don’t want to point out that some do a lot more good than others.

It’s understandable. They’re all well-intentioned, good projects. People care about them. You don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. But the truth is that, in the world we live in, we can’t afford not to be picky about our giving.

If all charities were as good as each other, then giving to less effective charities wouldn’t be a big deal. But there are huge differences. A safe and effective cataract operation can completely cure someone of blindness in the developing world for about $20. The same person can be provided with a seeing eye dog for $50,000. There are charities doing each.

Let’s not make any mistakes about this. Both charities are definitely helping people. But one is helping a lot more people with the same resources.

There’s something awkward here. It feels like we’re putting a price on helping people. We’d like to just help charities help people in need without having to think about scarce resources. It feels embarrassing to say to one charity “I’m sorry, I think my money can help more people somewhere else.” It seems much nicer to give a bit to all the good causes.

That’s a very costly attitude to have.

We live in a world plagued by urgent human suffering. A lot of it is suffering that we really can do something about. Neglected Tropical Diseases, for example, affect more than a billion people and cause about half a million deaths a year. Charities like [SCI]( http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto) can deliver treatment at a cost of about $0.70 per person to prevent crippling disabilities and death.

Clearly, it’s very important to focus on giving to highly effective charities like SCI. That’s why organisations around the world are turning their attention towards effective giving. Large-scale programmes like the Gates Foundation are using effectiveness data to inform their giving choices.

But it’s also important for individuals to take giving seriously. [Giving What We Can] (http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) is an organisation that encourages individuals to commit to donating 10% of their income to the most effective charities. They reckon that, on a really conservative estimate, their two hundred members have pledged about $75m over their lifetimes. That will save about 150,000 lives. [The Life You Can Save](http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com), which only asks for a minimum pledge of 1%, thinks its thirteen thousand members have already given $68m. All those little donations add up.

Personally, I find the idea of being able to help so many people, so easily, exciting. But some people I know get nervous about the idea. Who am I to say which charities are the best? How can you even compare them? Can you say that curing a case of TB is better or worse than defending someone’s civil rights?

They’ve got a point. Comparing charities is hard and we’re bound to make some mistakes. But not trying to compare them is even worse. You aren’t giving to every charity (and you shouldn’t) so you’re already comparing them. But the natural way to choose them, picking the ones that sound good, just doesn’t take the urgency of human suffering seriously enough.

The good news is that there are organisations out there to help. [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org) has a team of researchers who analyse charities to find the best ones out there.

That sort of project is a pretty new idea, but it’s one that’s gaining influence. Ten years from now, I’d be surprised if that dirty secret isn’t out in the open and we’re all thinking about effectiveness when we think about giving. It won’t be a moment too soon.

The scientific consensus is that the best way to predict someone’s career success is to assess their general mental ability (GMA), which is similar to what most people mean by “intelligence”. You might find this surprising, so I’m going to summarise the evidence backing it up. Then I’ll talk about: 

* Why GMA is so important in work - mainly because people with higher GMA learn faster.
* Which other factors affect success - job complexity, personality, and experience.
* What this all means for your career - choose jobs that fit your GMA and find the best ways to increase your chances of success.

##What is general mental ability (GMA)?
In 1904, psychologist and statistician Charles Spearman noticed that children tend to get similar marks in unrelated school subjects and he thought that there might be an underlying factor affecting their performance. He developed the statistical method of factor analysis to find how many underlying factors there were.[^1] Since then, many psychologists psychologists have used factor analysis to conclude that there is a single underlying general (or g) factor that explains people’s performance on different cognitive tests, although there is some disagreement about this.[^2] No single test measures general mental ability, but it can be measured from the results of tests of more specific cognitive abilities. But what is it? One description is “the ability to deal with cognitive complexity.” “[M]ore complex tasks require more mental manipulation, and this manipulation of information - discerning similarities and inconsistencies, drawing inferences, grasping new concepts and so on - constitutes intelligence in action.”[^3]

##General mental ability predicts career success: the evidence
Systematic analyses of thousands of studies support the idea that GMA is a good predictor of career success. Depending type of job and how performance is measured GMA explains between 30% and 70% of the variation in people’s work performance (i.e. correlations of between .56 and .84), which is larger than any other known predictor.[^4]

Before we look at this evidence in more detail, we need to know what we mean by success. There are 3 main measures of work success:
* Evaluation of performance on tasks similar to those encountered on the job (work-sample tests)
* Performance ratings by supervisors
* Position in the occupational hierarchy

All three are predicted by GMA.

First, GMA predicts performance on work-sample tasks and ratings of supervisors. Evidence from several meta-studies shows that when performance is measured using work-sample tests, the correlation between GMA and performance is 0.84. When supervisor ratings are used, the correlation is lower, at 0.74 for high-complexity jobs.[^5]

GMA also predicts how high up you get in the job hierarchy - i.e. your occupational level.[^6] US Employment Service data shows a strong correlation (0.72) between GMA and occupational level and US military data shows that mean GMA scores are higher at higher occupational levels. Also, there is a wider variety of GMA scores at lower occupational levels than at higher ones. It seems that there are high-scoring people in low-level occupations, but low-scoring people are unlikely to get promoted to higher levels.[^7]

But to fully show the link we need to track people with known GMA over time to see if high GMA individuals end up being more successful. This has been done.[^8] In a longitudinal study of 3,887 young adults, GMA predicted movement in the job hierarchy 5 years later. Another study found that if people were in a job that was less complex than their GMA would predict, they moved up to a more complex job and vice versa. The predictivity of GMA even holds when controlling for socioeconomic status by comparing biological siblings. “When the siblings were in their late 20s (in 1993), a person with average GMA was earning on average almost $18,000 less per year than his brighter sibling who had an IQ of 120 or higher and was earning more than $9,000 more than his duller sibling who had an IQ of less than 80.”[^9]

The link has also been confirmed by two natural experiments.[^10] In 1978 a US Steel plant in Pennsylvania changed the way they chose people for their skilled trades apprentice programs. Before the change they filled their positions with people who got the highest results on a GMA test. The plant replaced this system with a test that most people passed followed by allocation of jobs by seniority. The plant’s performance records show that after the new system was introduced trainees learned less and dropped out more. And because apprentices took longer to get through the course, training got more expensive.

The second natural experiment happened in the 1980s in Washington DC. The police force changed their selection procedures for new applicants from a GMA to a non-GMA based selection. After the change, it became more difficult to train new officers. 80% of new hires couldn’t complete the required training, so the content of the training had to be made easier. But the police officers produced from this training were often incompetent, which caused lots of problems. For example, the solution rate for murder cases declined from one of the highest to one of the lowest in the US. 

##Why does general mental ability predict success?
The evidence for the link between GMA and performance is strong, but it’s made more plausible by if we can understand *why* GMA predicts performance. GMA mainly influences performance through the rate at which people learn knowledge relevant to the job - people with higher GMA learn faster.[^11] But GMA predicts success even when you take account of job knowledge. With high GMA, people are more able to go beyond existing job knowledge and make judgements in unfamiliar situations.[^12]

##Other relevant factors

*Job complexity* 

Although GMA predicts performance in all jobs the more complex the job is[^13], the stronger the relationship between GMA and performance.[^14] And the more complex the job, the more variation there is between top performers and bottom performers.[^15] So if you have one of the highest levels of GMA in a highly complex job, you’ll have a high output compared to the average performer.

*Personality* 

You might think that personality matters more than GMA - some people seem to have the kind of drive that leads to success. And this is true - personality does matter, but less than general mental ability.[^16] The [consensus model of personality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) suggests that there are five fairly independent dimensions of personality. These are conscientiousness, emotional stability, agreeableness, extraversion, and openness to experience. Of these, the most valid predictor of success is conscientiousness with a correlation between conscientiousness and job performance of 0.31.[^17] So personality is predictive of success, but not as much as general mental ability. 

One possibility is that success is related to personality characteristics multiplied by GMA. So maybe someone with low conscientiousness wouldn’t be successful, however high their GMA was. One study suggests that this may be true: “the combination of highly general cognitive ability and motivation is significantly associated with more early career success.”[^18]

*Experience* 

The importance of experience is unclear. Some studies suggest that experience is less important than mental ability.[^19] Even more surprisingly, the more experience you have, the worse experience is as a predictor of success.[^20] For people with 0-3 years experience, the correlation between experience and performance is .49 but this drops to .15 for people with 12+ years of experience. Conversely, the strength of GMA as a predictor increases the more experience you have. With 0-3 years of experience, GMA correlates with performance at .35 but this rises to .59 for people with 12+ years of experience.  One source suggests that after a few years, additional experience doesn’t lead to more job knowledge and therefore doesn’t increase performance.[^21] 

However, this is highly unintuitive - some people spend decades developing expertise and don’t reach a plateau after 5 years. Top performers in most fields tend to be middle-aged (think of scientists, CEOs, chess-players). If experience didn’t matter that much after about 5 years then we’d expect to see a wider spread of ages at the top.[^22] Since fluid intelligence (the ability to reason using novel information as opposed to existing knowledge) declines as people get older,[^23] we’d expect the top performers in many fields to be young.

We can try and resolve this apparent contradiction as follows. Perhaps the research showing that the importance of experience declines is correct for many jobs because these jobs have a relatively small amount of knowledge that needs to be learnt. Once this is learnt, the main determinant of success is GMA because it predicts people’s ability to reason in novel situations. However, some jobs have much more knowledge and experience required, so it takes decades to become an expert. 

Even further than this, we could divide jobs into those that require a great deal of knowledge and those that don’t require so much knowledge but do require a strong ability to reason in novel ways. Then we’d expect top performers in the knowledge-dependent jobs to be older and those in the novel reasoning jobs to be younger. This is what we observe:[^24] people in pure maths, theoretical physics, and lyric poetry tend to peak in their 20s or 30s, whereas people other fields such as history, novel writing, philosophy, and medicine tend to peak in their 40s or 50s.

##Common objections to this research
I have covered the importance of personality and experience above, but there are other possible objections:

*Aren’t specific aptitudes more important?* 

You might think that specific aptitudes (such as verbal, spatial, or numerical ability) would predict job performance better than GMA, since different jobs seem to need different specific aptitudes. Because of this, you’d expect that you could predict success better if you gave people specific aptitude tests and put more emphasis on the aptitudes that were most relevant to the job. It’s not clear whether this is true. One review paper[^25] suggests that if you make a test that weights certain specific aptitudes more than others, it doesn’t have much more predictive power than a general mental ability test. This paper suggests that specific aptitude tests are predictive, but they are predictive because they measure g as well as measuring the specific aptitude. However, there is [a theory of cognitive abilities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattell%E2%80%93Horn%E2%80%93Carroll_theory) that says that there are approximately 8 broad abilities and there is some debate as to whether they can be summarised into a single general factor.[^26]  Even more importantly, the correlations between these specific abilities is lower for people of high ability.[^27] So if you’re intelligent you should consider whether you have one type of ability which you are much stronger in than others.

*Doesn’t GMA only matter up to a certain level?*

It’s possible that for each job there is a certain level of general mental ability required, and after that level is reached there is not much benefit from being more able. If this was true, we’d expect to see a non-linear relationship between GMA and performance. But overall,
the relationship between GMA and performance seems to be linear. One meta-study[^28] analysed 174 studies involving a total of 36,614 people and tested for linearity.  They found that nonlinear relationships were not found at levels greater than expected by chance. However, this study did not cover the highest and lowest ends of the occupational spectrum very well.[^29] Similarly, most of the studies I referenced earlier have been done on large populations of people with fairly normal jobs and so unusual patterns at the highest levels could have been missed. It’s still possible that the very highest jobs and achievements need only a certain level of GMA, and other factors are more important beyond that level. Malcolm Gladwell claims this in his book Outliers.[^30] He suggests that while Nobel prize winners are intelligent, they aren’t necessarily of the very highest intelligence. Gladwell’s evidence is quite weak - he supports his claims with single studies, anecdote, and quotes from experts. This kind of evidence is not strong in psychology, where results often turn out to not be repeatable. Overall, I haven’t seen strong evidence either way on whether GMA is predictive at the very highest levels. However, given that GMA is so strongly predictive for most jobs, I suspect that the pattern will hold even at high levels.

*If GMA predicts success, why is it not more commonly known?* 

Many companies [do not use tests of GMA in their hiring](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mr-personality/201203/the-unspoken-truth-about-career-success-suck-and-keep-your-boss-happy). If GMA is so predictive of work success, why would this be? Here are some possibilities, although I don’t have evidence on this:
* It may simply be that hiring managers don’t know about the evidence. The first meta-studies on the topic were done in the 1980s and so perhaps this knowledge hasn’t filtered through to hiring managers yet.
* It may be that employers are worried about legal or worker morale issues from using ability tests in job interviews.
* Some of the conclusions of this research are unintuitive - e.g. that experience often doesn’t matter as much as GMA for job performance.
* Perhaps they do select for GMA, but indirectly, through interviews and assessments of past performance.

##What this means for your career
Some of your career options will be more of a gamble than others. Most accountants, for example, will earn a good salary and be able to donate a lot of money to charity. But in some careers only a few people can have an impact and they have a disproportionate amount of impact. Research is one example - only a few researchers make the most important breakthroughs. Entrepreneurship is another example - most new businesses fail but a few become so successful that their owners can donate hundreds of millions to charity. Because there’s more [variation between people’s performance in highly complex jobs](http://80000hours.org/blog/69-how-good-are-the-best)[^31] and because these jobs require higher GMA we’d expect that people with higher GMA will have a better chance of succeeding at highly variable careers like research and entrepreneurship. People with lower GMA might want to go into lower-variance jobs with more sure outcomes.

From personal experience, I’ve also found it useful to know that job knowledge is a strong predictor of performance. Since reading the evidence about GMA and success, I have concentrated more on effective learning and choosing the most useful job-related knowledge to learn.

##Does this mean that you can’t do much to improve your chances of success?##
On first reading this, you might be worried that there is very little you can do about your chances of success. But these results shouldn’t cause you to give up:

First, it may be possible to increase your GMA. I haven’t seen evidence on whether or not this is possible, but it’s worth investigating.

Second, impact isn’t the same as what most people call success. You could have far more impact than someone with much higher GMA just by taking opportunities for impact that other people don’t know about. 

Third, the studies I’ve quoted didn’t look at whether some people achieved more success than you’d expect from their GMA. Perhaps some people used better methods of working. We know from the GMA and success research that job knowledge is an important predictor of success. So how can you learn more effectively? [This paper](http://psi.sagepub.com/content/14/1/4.full.pdf)[^32] (summarised [here](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/01/130110111734.htm)) shows that the methods most commonly used by students are not the most effective and it shows which methods are the most useful. And few people know that using a [spaced repetition system](http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition) can improve your learning. Apart from learning, there are probably other areas ways you can improve your chances of success such as becoming more conscientious[^33] or by building a network.

So don’t see this evidence on the link between GMA and success as a reason to give up - instead use it to understand that a major cause of success is a mixture of knowledge and the ability to think, and find ways to improve your ability at those things. And then look for other major determinants of success and improve on those. In the future, we’ll write more on other determinants of success and how to improve your chances.

This agewise pattern apparently holds for such endeavors as lyric poetry, pure mathematics, and theoretical physics, forexample (Adams, 1946; Dennis, 1966; Lehman, 1953a; Moulin, 1955; Roe, 1972b; Simonton, 1975a; Van Heeringen & Dijkwel, 1987).

Unfortunately, I do not know how to do that fancy indenting quote thing. But I am curious as to your reasoning behind this claim. IQ is considered a very controversial measure of "intelligence", and even in early childhood I would imagine any difference in score between two humans is significantly less than their difference when they grow up if their environmental influences are different.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>968</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>970</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>gwern</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>gwern@gwern.net</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-04-06 00:30:47</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[> IQ is considered a very controversial measure of “intelligence”

No, it's not. It's controversial only among laymen and ideologues; the field of psychology has long accepted IQ because it works incredibly well. See the field-wide consensus report produced in reply to _The Bell Curve_ in the '90s, or the more recent consensus paper by Nisbett.

Here’s some evidence that IQ is predictive at even the very high levels:

* SAT-M scores within the top 1% of the population <A href="http://goo.gl/IgOPp">predict future scientific success</A>.

* The IQs of participants in the Terman study of gifted individuals (who had minimum IQ of 135) <A href="http://infoproc.blogspot.com.ar/2011/04/earnings-effects-of-personality.html">were positively correlated with lifetime earnings</A>.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>979</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Alex</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>alexander.white45@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-04-06 21:45:19</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Refreshing post, just because a lot of the realities of IQ (or g, take your pick) are often skipped by career guides. In fact, when a book about careers does not mention IQ I get skeptical of whether the author knows their stuff or is even deliberately misleading people. It seems like IQ is pretty much square one on this topic. 

However, I have to question this post's advice that if your IQ is higher you should try riskier paths while if your IQ is lower you should seek surer paths. Actually, my first guess would be that no clear relationship exists. For example, I don't think that acting requires tremendous IQ (although some actors are very smart) but it certainly is a profession where luck plays a greater than usual role in defining who reaches the top. On the other hand, being a doctor requires a certain minimal IQ but once you graduate it's certainly less risky than working at a hedge fund or being an entrepreneur. 

We know that genetics explains 50-80% of the variance in IQ among populations coming from middle-class families. Plus the test-retest correlation for the same person is apparently around 0.9. I don't know whether that is over a period of years or not. But overall, trying to change your IQ sounds to me like a pretty foolhardy venture. (Though if they invent NZT-48 like in the movie Limitless...) It seems much better to take IQ as given and then use that to help select a suitable career. 

It seems that way, anyway--but using IQ at all might not be straightforward in practice. Ideally you would want some kind of formula. You're at the kth percentile in the IQ distribution. Your level of conscientiousness is this, your level of extroversion is that, etc. One of the recommendations on this site a while ago was to use Glassdoor to look up salary data based on seniority. My response to that is, how do you estimate what level of seniority you can expect to attain? One way might be with your IQ, but the issue there is that you don't know what the average IQ is for a seniority level. In fact, I'm not even sure you know the percentile of people at a given seniority level on these sites--if you did though, you could construct IQ estimates based on the mean IQ in the profession and a normal distribution assumption. Maybe someone with experience on Glassdoor knows whether such percentiles are available. But without them I don't see how Glassdoor would be all that useful in choosing a career. 

I'd be particularly interested to see breakdowns of how personality traits affect success in different careers. 

IQ also only predicts I think about a quarter of the variance in income. From an income perspective my guess would be that career choice is of comparable importance. And practically, it's a lot *more* important because unlike IQ you can readily change career area. This is one paper that has helped shaped my thinking on career choices:

http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/transitions_career_and_family_lifecycles_of_the_educational_elite_1.pdf

I'd be interested to see a study that breaks down income by both individual career choices and IQ levels. But since I don't know of any study like that, I've been using a pretty simple working rule: if your primary goal is high income and your IQ is over 120 then go for finance or consulting. Or entrepreneurship--but this last option is not for the risk-averse, which as this site has mentioned is no small issue. I'd be curious to know how to make a choice between entrepreneurship, finance, and consulting though. 

Of course, you might also be more interested in influence or free time or something else besides money. And family background and connections matter. If you are the son of a US senator, for example, going into politics has a bigger expected payoff than for the average person. 

It also seems fair to say that you don't want to go choosing a career where the top performers have very high IQs, if you don't have that IQ and you wouldn't be happy not being a top performer. And this actually I think raises serious questions for people thinking of research careers. Research, in the hard sciences but probably also many humanities, requires copious IQ to reach the top. On this site they've written about how the most successful researchers have by far the largest impact; that's made a real impression on me. If you're even considering a career in research and getting a PhD then you probably already have a fairly high IQ. But there is a big difference between a fairly high IQ and a stellar IQ that gives a person a greatly improved chance of breakout research success. 

I'd also be interested to see a comparison of how strongly IQ predicts research success versus predicting entrepreneurial success. The average IQ of a Nobel Prize winner is reportedly around 145. Is there some corresponding statistic for successful founders?]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>981</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Alex</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>alexander.white45@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-04-06 22:35:32</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA["I’d be curious to know how to make a choice between entrepreneurship, finance, and consulting though."

In particular, doing what you’re passionate about might prevent you from making the most difference - if what you’re passionate about is contract killings, for example. The example doesn’t even need to be this extreme: what if what you really love has relatively low impact on others, like meatpacking? It seems like your time could be put to more altruistic use, even if you’re not doing something actively harmful.

The problem is that we all still want to find a career which makes us happy: but for many there seems to be a conflict between doing what one loves, and making a difference. My initial interest in 80,000 Hours was sparked by a desire to resolve a conflict between wanting to make a difference in my career, and wanting to pursue philosophy research (which I considered fairly low impact.)(1) I recognised that I could potentially make more difference by applying my numerical skills to a high-earning career and donating to greater causes - but the thing is, I just don’t want to do this. And shouldn’t this count for something, even for the aspiring effective altruist? Should we have to give up doing what we love in order to make a difference?

I’d like to suggest that this conflict, although it exists, may be much less than it first appears - for there’s a connection between job satisfaction and making a difference. Firstly, making a difference can be one of the most satisfying ways to lead a career (which I’ll focus on in this post). Secondly, we’re more likely to make a difference in a career which satisfies us (which I’ll explore later).

###Being altruistic makes us happy###

Psychological research suggests that acting altruistically tends to make us happier than being selfish does. Whether rich or poor, black or white, bankers or charity workers, people who volunteer report better health and happiness than those who do not.(2) Furthermore, a [TED talk given by Martin Seligman](http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/martin_seligman_on_the_state_of_psychology.html), a professor in psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, reports that the happiness we get from doing something for someone else has been shown to last longer than the happiness we get by doing something for ourselves.  

A paper by bioethicist Stephen Post cites a number of studies connecting altruism and happiness, suggesting that these results are wide-ranging and can be generalised.(3) It also attempts to provide a rationale for the connection: altruistic acts result in more positive social integration, distract from personal problems and enhance meaning and purpose, all of which relate to positive psychology. We might therefore reasonably expect these results to be mirrored in job satisfaction: jobs which help others should tend to be more satisfying, and produce longer-lasting satisfaction than those based on purely selfish principles. This is directly supported by the job satisfaction literature - see [our post](http://80000hours.org/blog/68-how-to-find-a-job-you-ll-love)

###Having a purpose makes us happy###

As well as linking altruism to happiness directly, leading an altruistic career might also lead to greater job satisfaction indirectly, by providing a sense of purpose. Martin Seligman identifies three different possible orientations to happiness: pleasure, engagement, and meaning.(4) The pursuit of pleasure has been endorsed since the doctrine of hedonism was first articulated and then used to lay the foundations of utilitarianism. However, whilst pleasure does play a role in determining our happiness, research suggests that the pursuit of meaning and engagement are stronger predictors of overall life satisfaction than the pursuit of pleasure. (5)

A life of meaning is one in which we develop our skills and talents and then apply them towards some greater good. This seems to be precisely what we mean when we talk about “making a difference” or “having an impact” - making a contribution towards something bigger than ourselves. The idea that making a difference is a good way to achieve job (and life) satisfaction goes all the way back to  the Aristotle notion of [eudaimonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia), and has been reinforced by the more recent work of Seligman and others.

The third orientation of engagement is closely related to, and motivated by, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s work on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow phenomenon</a>. Flow is completely focused motivation, and the state which results from being completely immersed (or engaged) in an activity. Flow is distinct from pleasure or enjoyment: it’s generally considered an unconscious state. Although people may describe flow as enjoyable, this tends to be a judgement made in retrospect, rather than a feeling actually present during the activity. Flow is, however, strongly connected with both positive emotions and increased productivity (5) - the latter which itself tends to lead to a greater sense of achievement and so greater satisfaction. Although engagement and meaning are distinct: we can find ourselves fully engaged in activities which serve no higher purpose, and not all meaningful activities may allow us to achieve the state of flow, the two often coincide. In particular, Seligman suggests that engaging in altruistic activity and acts of kindness are often a good way to experience this unconscious state of flow. (4)

###Conclusion###

Given that:

1. Helping others is directly connected to positive psychology,
2. Aiming at engagement and meaning is a better way to achieve satisfaction than aiming at pleasure; and
3. Doing things which are altruistic or aimed at a greater cause are good ways to achieve engagement and meaning,

it seems reasonable to conclude that making a difference could be a very good way to achieve job satisfaction - far from conflicting with it. In fact, we may perhaps be more satisfied seeking high impact or altruistic careers (which aim at a purpose beyond ourselves) than seeking careers we anticipate enjoying (which are aimed at pleasure.) As I’ll explore in a later post, our attempts to directly predict what makes us happy can often be flawed.

This has already had huge impact. For example, at the end of 2012 Good Ventures awarded [$2 million in grants](https://www.facebook.com/notes/good-ventures/giving-season-grants-to-givewells-top-charities/542998472395716) to GiveWell’s top recommended charities.

**Key career points:**
* Initially choosing jobs that you are good at, helps to be able to have impact and influence later in your career.
* More broadly, paying attention to abilities and fit when choosing a career is important for estimating the impact of your career.
* The direct impact of your job is important because the creation of wealth and improvement of productivity generally benefit the world as a whole in the long-term.
* Academia is a career you have to decide about relatively early on in your life.
* As an entrepreneur, passion and belief in your project is very important for eventual success.

**What were the biggest decisions you made in your career, and how did they lead you to your current role?**

It wasn’t a very deliberative process; when I got out of college I just wanted a job and the only thing I knew that I wanted was to earn money. There was something about going travelling around the world for a year or going to grad school that just didn’t sit with me. I didn’t have a good reason, but I thought I was going to go insane if I spent more time borrowing money and learning and gathering information instead of going out and doing something. I wanted to live in New York and so I looked for jobs there, and I got three offers. I took the best offer in terms of convenience and pay, which was a job at a hedge fund. 

After a year there I applied for jobs at companies recruiting in colleges, again looking for something that sounded interesting and would pay me well. I was given an offer from another hedge fund and I really liked the people who interviewed me. It sounded like what they were doing was really intellectually fascinating. They were in an area of markets that is not the most quantified and there are a lot of qualitative things you need to do to make good predictions and they were making good predictions. So I wanted to see how they did that and I thought it would make me smarter about understanding the world and making predictions. I didn’t think that this was the job that would have the most impact, but I thought that this is a job that I have available to me that will develop my general personal talents. And then at the hedge fund I was trying to give away my own money and that’s what led to GiveWell.

Just to be clear, I was always very focused on social impact; it’s not like I just wanted money so that I could buy things. There were just so many things out there and I knew so little about the world, that I thought the proper first step would be to have a real job and build my skills at something and bounce around until I found something that made sense. 

Also, while I was at the hedge fund, I spent a lot of my free time trying to think about what I could do to have maximal positive impact on the world. I came up with a lot of ideas for businesses or nonprofits. But ultimately I think the best idea I came up with was the one I bumped into because I was, myself, an underserved customer, and therefore I could see and verify a real unfilled void, not just theorize about something that seemed to be an unfilled void. I don’t think this is a coincidence. I think a lot of the best ideas get “bumped into” because it’s hard to know that something is a real need, and one way is by actually needing it.

**Looking back at the process you went through in your career choice, how would you evaluate it?**

It was a process that wasn’t as good as it could have been. I could have used help from an organization like 80,000 Hours. I think I made good decisions, but one of the things I could have used help with is understanding what it’s like to be an academic. People usually either completely ignore that possibility or they completely ignore every other possibility. And it’s something you have to decide on quite soon. My path of rolling around in different jobs to see what would develop me personally would have disqualified me from academia after a certain point. I don’t think I should have been an academic, but I think I should have thought about it harder and been more informed about what it involved. I think an organization like 80,000 Hours could have helped me be more certain that I didn’t want to be an academic, and I might have been an entrepreneur earlier, because I think I do actually have an entrepreneur personality and skill set, but I didn’t realise that. I wasn’t very aware of entrepreneurship and I could have been. Another example where I could have used help is that I applied and got rejected twice from Teach for America. I obviously wasn’t a good fit; I just didn’t have the right personality for it.

**How did you get the idea to start GiveWell?**

When I was working at the hedge fund and looking to give and do as much good as possible, I realised that I was just way too busy and that there was nowhere for me to even start, there was no information that I could get which was even vaguely comparative, in terms of comparing charities impacts, and looking for the highest impact one. That was what led to starting GiveWell.

**How optimistic were you about GiveWell becoming a success?**

I looked at the size of the charitable giving market, and I realised that even 1% of the market would be $2bn/year. I didn’t necessarily think 1% was doable, but at least I knew that GiveWell didn’t need to be a mainstream phenomenon to be impactful. I didn’t know if we would find enough people to have much impact but I was just so passionate about what we were doing and believed in it so much, that I felt like it was crazy if there weren’t enough people to support this idea. It was kind of irrational. This is a very common phenomenon in entrepreneurs - starting a new organisation is hard and it has a lot of ups and it has really deep downs.  So it’s very common for entrepreneurs to be a little bit insane and convinced that their idea is good, without necessarily having the data to believe it.

**Where do you see your own career going?**

I see myself as being at GiveWell indefinitely, possibly for the rest of my life, although I’m open to anything. Certainly I’m now at the point where I would definitely leave and do something else if I thought that it had higher social impact, and I would have the ability to assess that more than I did when I was out of college. But I don’t really expect that to happen, so I expect to be at GiveWell indefinitely. 

**What are your tips on how to choose a career with the highest social impact?**

When it comes to picking a career, I really think that abilities and fit, and to some extent interest, are really important. It’s the kind of thing where you get very high variance and it will be detectable variance, in how well a job fits you and how well it fits your abilities and interests. Whereas I think that doing conceptual cost effectiveness analysis on which careers do the most good is very hard to do well, to a degree that is going to have low enough error bars to really play much of a role in the decision.

My advice is to start with what are you good at, what are you interested in, what job is a good fit for you. Then once you have a lot of jobs on the table, then narrow it down based on social impact. For example, you don’t want to be a salesperson for a tobacco company, when comparing it to being a fundraiser for a great non-profit. So there are differences that I think are semi-obvious and not too hard to detect. But I think a lot of differences are much harder to discern. As an example: say someone is trying to decide if they want to work in tech software or in non-profit fundraising. I actually think the question of which of these has higher social impact is really vexed. And it’s not going to do a lot of good to try and answer that question. I think it’s going to be more productive to look at which environment is a better fit for a person and leads to their being more productive and more excited about the job.

GiveWell has been the kind of thing that if I hadn’t been super passionate about it, it would have just fallen apart. And I think that to have a really high impact in a job, if the fit isn’t there, it will fall apart no matter what your social impact calculations say. Also the jobs that don’t seem to have high social impact, if you’re really good at them, you will gain in status, connections, contacts, you’ll learn things you never would have thought and you’ll be in unexpected positions to do good. 

This is all from the frame of assuming the main goal is to do the most good for the world; I’m not saying that people should drop the idea of social impact, I’m saying what I think is the best way to get there.

**Do you think that being good at a job is what you would expect to produce a lot of value, even apart for all the indirect things such gaining status and connections and building up skills which you can use later?**

My intuition is that a really high fraction of the good that you accomplish with your career is the actual work that you are doing. When I think about the good done by a software company, I first and foremost think about what software does for the world, not about how much one will make and can give to charity, although that’s important too. But what software does for the world is a really big factor and it’s hard to estimate how much good is done by that.

**Does this assume that the market is roughly efficient? If you believed that the market was often very inefficient, then just because you could get a job that you were really good at, you might not think that you would produce much social value through that job.**

I don’t think I am assuming that. I think that a lot of jobs you can do have a lot of social value. I think that contributing to economic growth has a lot of social value and I think that making things more efficient has a lot of social value. I don’t think that requires an efficient market hypothesis. I am assuming a connection between productivity and social impact, which is something I believe for a reason, which is that creation of wealth and improvement of efficiency and productivity generally benefit the world as a whole. I do believe that. 

**Can you summarise your views on why job abilities are more important to consider when choosing careers rather than social impact?**

It seems that there are two arguments that I’ve made for paying a lot of attention to job abilities and fit. You could imagine a formula where S is the social impact factor of your work - how much good is done by a unit of efficiency produced. E is your efficiency at the job, how good you are at it. So then social impact = E * S. But we have a much better estimate of E than of S. S has giant uncertainty bars around it. Though this is not always true, because sometimes S is distinguishable between options, as in the case of the tobacco company. But in a lot of cases, like tech versus non-profit I feel like it’s too hard to pin down which one has the better S, and so focusing on E is a way to get better direct impact. 

Then there’s a totally separate argument that job trajectories tend to be more related to your effectiveness at a job than to their social impact factor, so even if you know what’s the most socially impactful, you may still want to focus on your skills because status, credentials and networks are so important to amass early in your career. Then later on you will be better positioned to take something with a high social impact factor and do it with high efficiency.

Thinking about social impact is very valuable when you’re narrowing down the field. But there are so many other constraints: what jobs can you actually get at your age, what jobs are the ones where the environment or the manager and the people fit you well. The more options you have, the more factors it makes sense to be narrowing things on, and one of those should be estimated social impact (the “S” factor) to be sure. And the more expertise and skills and status you gain, the more it makes sense to be thinking about how to apply them for maximal “S”, whereas when you’re still short on such things, it makes sense to be thinking about how to gain them.

Robin Hanson is an American economist who [recently blogged](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/11/marginal-charity.html) about an elegant way to help others at little personal cost. The logic goes like this:

*When making decisions people usually try to do the thing which is best for them. We can call this the ‘private optimum’.
* However, a choice that is best for them is not always the best decision for society as a whole - what we can call the ‘social optimum’.
* Around the ‘private optimum’, small changes in either direction don’t make a big difference to the person involved. For instance, imagine that you are having a meal and deciding how much to eat. At the point where you are consuming ‘just the right amount’, the benefit of eating more is perfectly balanced by its cost. In economic language you are ‘indifferent’ between eating a little more and a little less. By contrast, if you are desperately hungry, or painfully stuffed with food, the benefits and costs of eating are far apart. In one case you really want to eat more, in the other case you really want to eat less; when you are so far away from where you ideally want to be, each extra mouthful matters much more.
* As a result, the bigger the difference between the private and social optimums, the more valuable it is to take given step towards the social optimum (see the Figure below).[^1] Therefore, in cases where the private and social optimums are far apart, people who push us a bit towards the social optimum can do a lot for general well-being. 
* This means that in these cases you can take actions that involve a small private loss but have a big social gain. That sounds like an ideal project for an ‘effective altruist’!

This is an neat observation because it involves so few assumptions:

* People are trying to choosing the point which is best for them along a continuum.
* The best point for society is not the same as the best point for them, and we know in which direction it lies.

The upside of trying to use this insight is that it promises a big ‘benefit to cost’ ratio. Given how many decisions we make, it seems like there should be many such situations where we could shift our behaviour a little towards the benevolent one. These actions might include being a bit friendlier to waitstaff when you are overseas, who in turn should provide you with somewhat better service than they need to, given that you won’t be coming back. Or it could be deciding not to drive during bad traffic - leaving a bit more room for everyone else.

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/92/original/incremental_improvement_wiblin_post.png?1361407237'><img alt="Incremental_improvement_wiblin_post" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/92/large/incremental_improvement_wiblin_post.png?1361407237" /></a>

Unfortunately, there are downsides too. For one, by its nature this approach cannot effectively absorb many resources. The more you move away from your private optimum, the more the incremental cost to you rises and the incremental benefit to others falls. I don’t know if this technique could effectively use 0.5% or 5% of an individual’s income, but I would be very surprised if it went higher than that. Another problem is that it’s not always easy to know in which situations the private and social optimums are far apart, or even in which direction you should be moving. If you happen to have a good idea of how the world works that will help! It might even be worth studying a bit more to help you make these judgements. But most of our consumer decisions are much more mundane. Are you better off spending a bit more time with your friends, or a bit more time at work? Should you buy a bit more, or a bit less, coffee? Should you go on more overseas trips, or fewer? Given the effort required to work out the answers to these questions, I would worry that dealing with all of these micro-decisions would draw your attention and motivation away from the crucial macro-decisions.

However, this isn’t the case for everyone. Those who own or operate businesses make major decisions about the quality and price of products that will be used by many people, or how they treat their employees. A compelling example offered by Hanson is a company choosing how tall to build its apartment blocks. There is a general consensus among public policy experts that we would be better off with taller buildings, and adding extra floors to the design is a decision that changes how hundreds of thousands of dollars are spent - not just the small change you would redirect at the supermarket. Similarly, a business which is a bit more compassionate to its employees when they are in need would lose little overall, while potentially improving their workers’ quality of life a great deal.

This is a good foundation on which to build the idea of effective ‘corporate social responsibility’. Unfortunately, the main goal of corporate social responsibility is for businesses to look good to their customers. Most of these incremental changes to product quality and price or kindness to employees are invisible, and so can’t be used for such showing off. How could you ever prove that you would have had one less floor on your apartment if only you weren’t such a nice guy?

This is no surprise after all. People are already motivated to engage in showy acts of kindness, whether they help others or not. The low hanging fruit usually involves doing something a little less conspicuous!

On the other hand, there is an upside to such choices being hidden. Not only can’t the public see that you had their back in a toss-up decision at your business - your managers or shareholders won’t be able to tell either! So, if you want to be a undercover hero and happen to work in a big organisation, it’s easy to start nudging us towards a kinder world.

A big part of the problem is that we’re pretty bad at predicting how happy things will make us, or how long that happiness will last. We think, for example, that winning the lottery will make us much happier in the long run - but it probably won’t.(1) This has some serious ramifications for career choice.

In an earlier post, I concluded that there’s a much closer connection between careers which make us happy and careers that make a difference than we might think. One side of this relationship is that we’re more likely to make a difference in a career we enjoy. This means that even for the effective altruist, factoring in our own happiness at least to some extent when making career decisions is important. However, what this doesn’t mean is that we should simply follow our intuition (or our [passions](http://80000hours.org/blog/63-don-t-do-what-you-re-passionate-about-part-2)) about what makes us happy, and then factor this in to our decisions.

We have a tendency to overestimate both the positive impact of a “good” event (such as winning the lottery), and the negative impact of something “bad” happening (such as breaking a leg.) One study showed that accident victims often turn out to be happier a year after their accident than they expect to be.(1) Another asked professors to predict the long-term impact that either receiving or failing to receive tenure would have on their happiness: and lo and behold, in both cases the emotional impact (whether positive or negative) was overestimated.(2) If we can’t even predict what kind of sandwich we will want for lunch next week (3), then predicting what kind of career we will enjoy in five or ten year’s time seems like a hopeless task.

Why are we so bad at predicting what will make us happy? When we try to predict our emotional reaction to future events, we tend to *simulate*: we imagine ourselves in a future situation, which elicits an emotional reaction in the present. We then use this emotional reaction as a predictor of how we *would* react in the given situation.(4) So when I imagine feeling anxious sitting an exam, what I really do is imagine sitting an exam, which makes me feel anxious, and then take this anxiety as an indicator of the feeling I would expect to have when I actually sit the exam.(5)

The way in which we use simulation to predict our future emotional states provides a route into understanding why such predictions often go so far awry.

###Our current emotional state affects our future predictions###

Since we predict our future emotions based on an emotional reaction *in the present* to a simulated situation, our present emotions are liable to affect our predictions. A tendency to project our current preferences onto a future event is known as the [projection bias](http://www.spring.org.uk/2008/05/why-your-future-self-is-emotional.php). People at a gym who had just worked out on a treadmill (and were therefore thirsty) were much more likely to predict that thirst would be more unpleasant than hunger if lost in the woods, than those asked before using the treadmill (who were not thirsty).(6) It seems that when trying to imagine how they would feel when lost in the woods, the thirsty people were unable to ignore their current thirst in judging their future reactions.

Making big career decisions can often require us to predict how much we will enjoy a job in several years’ time, and it seems likely that by then some of our tastes and feelings will have changed - our desire to be working in the busiest part of London may be less strong aged 30 when we want to settle down with a family than aged 25, for example. The way in which we use simulations to predict future happiness suggests that we find it difficult to account for changes in our current emotional states when predicting how we’ll feel in the future.


###We rely on the past to predict the future###

In simulating future events, a big part is played by our memories of similar past events: we base our judgement of what a doctor’s appointment will be like largely on our memory of past appointments, for example. However, our memories are often unrepresentative of the past events themselves, and therefore also of future ones. 

Unusual and recent events tend to be more memorable, meaning they play a greater role in shaping our judgement of future events. When asked to remember a time when they missed a train, people tend to recall the most negative such experiences.(7) This makes them likely to overestimate how painful their next train-missing experience will be. 

Similarly, we might overestimate how much we will enjoy (or dislike) a certain component of a job if our simulation of it is skewed by the more extreme of our past memories.

###Simulations only account for essential features###

According to [construal level theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construal_level_theory), we tend to conceptualize future events much more abstractly than immediate ones. A similar point is that our simulations are *essentialist* - they are comprised of only the most important features. 

This makes sense: simulating future events is often hard to do, and we can’t possibly focus on every minute detail, so we just include the most important ones. The problem is that our perception of what are the most important features is fallible - leaving our simulations susceptible to the [focalism bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focalism). 

By basing our emotional predictions on what we deem the most important features of a future event, we may miss out on some non-essential features which would regardless make a big difference to our emotional responses.

One explanation for why the tenured professors ended up less happy than predicted might be that they focused overly on certain positive features of their tenure: the sense of achievement and recognition, at the neglect of others: increased working hours and dull departmental meetings, for example. 

When deciding which career to pursue, therefore, we are likely to focus our attention on factors which come to mind easily such as salary and working hours. This might lead us to ignore other factors which are actually crucial to predicting happiness like [mental challenge](http://80000hours.org/blog/68-how-to-find-a-job-you-ll-love). 

Initiatives like 80,000 hours help to counteract the focalism bias in career choice, by drawing attention to factors which people don’t tend to focus on.

###We forget that emotions fade over time###

A final point is that when predicting how a future event will make us feel, we tend to focus on its early features at the neglect of later ones. This might help explain why the lottery winners and accident victims overestimated the impact of the event: they imagined how they would feel immediately after winning, or having the accident, and assumed that this feeling would last. 

However, emotions fade in intensity over time, and we tend to underestimate this and the speed at which it happens.(8) This is the [durability bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_bias): a tendency to overestimate the emotional impact of an event in duration. 

Susceptibility to the durability bias means, for example, that we might expect a job with immediate rewards (like a high starting bonus) to make us much happier than it actually will in the long run.

###Conclusion###

So although we need to factor in our own happiness when making career decisions, simply using our intuitions to predict what makes us happy isn’t the way to do it. We’re overly biased by our current preferences, rely too heavily on selective memories, miss out potentially important features and underestimate the extent to which our emotions fade over time. 

Taking account of what we *think* will make us happy is pointless if these predictions aren’t remotely accurate - especially if we’re weighing this up against other important factors. In the next post I’ll talk about how we might try to factor in our own happiness whilst avoiding these biases.

The second group, however, who have to predict what they will want in advance, tend to opt for variety.

We might be tempted to conclude from this that a career’s potential to make a difference should be the primary factor we consider in career choice, and hope that job satisfaction follows on this basis.(1) Sadly I don’t think it’s so straightforward. As I will show, we’re more likely to succeed, and therefore to make more difference, in careers we enjoy. So we still need to think about which careers we’ll enjoy.

Consider a career that has the potential to be very high-impact if done well: some kinds of scientific research, for example. Suppose however that such a career is undertaken by someone who has little or no interest in the research involved. As I mentioned in part 1, I was hesitant to pursue research in a field I was passionate about because I felt that it was likely to be relatively low-impact. Trying to strike a balance between what I perceived enjoying and what would make the most difference, I considered other routes of research that might potentially be higher impact: such as neuroscience. But since I couldn’t imagine being passionate about research that involved spending my time doing experiments in a lab (2), I found it hard to see myself producing ground-breaking research in this field.

It seems like a lack of passion doesn’t translate well into effective work. The intuition here is that the relationship between job satisfaction and effective altruism goes both ways, since effectiveness increases if we find a job satisfying. Some research supporting these intuitions:

###If we’re happy, we’re more productive###

Most of us would probably report from our own experience that we tend to work more productively when we’re in a good mood than when in a miserable one. A study conducted at the University of Warwick demonstrates this, showing that raised happiness levels lead to a rise in productivity in a paid piece-rate task.(3) Two groups were asked to add sets of five 2-digit numbers. Both groups were paid a set rate for the task and told that in addition they could earn more depending on how many calculations they performed correctly. Participants in one group were shown a comedy video clip before watching the task, demonstrated to increase their happiness levels, whilst the second, “control” group saw no video. Those in the video clip group demonstrated a statistically significant rise in productivity over those in the control group, suggesting that a rise in happiness leads to greater productivity.

A paper reviewing 300 studies suggests that this correlation between job satisfaction and performance generalises.(4) There’s also evidence that it’s replicated at the team level, demonstrating a relationship between employee satisfaction and the overall performance of businesses.(5)

In the [aforementioned paper](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/workingpapers/2008/twerp_882.pdf), two theoretical models which might explain this connection between happiness and productivity are proposed. Assume each person has some finite amount of psychological resources. We have to decide how to distribute these resources across different activities - so for the purposes of this model we separate energy devoted to solving tasks at work, and energy devoted to other things.  One possible explanation is that increased happiness leads to an increase in total resources available to the worker. Unless all these extra resources are put into other things (6), the energy devoted to work-related tasks must therefore also increase: explaining the increase in productivity. The second proposal is that an increase in happiness leaves total resources fixed but reduces the energy spent on concerns outside of work: as we’d expect happiness to correlate with fewer outside work pressures and stresses. This allows the worker to devote more of their overall effort to work-related tasks.

<i>The Candle Problem </i>
</center>
* * * 

Research conducted by psychologist Alice Isen suggests that happiness (or [positive affect]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_affect)) also enhances problem solving and decision making.(7) A variety of studies, using various different ways of inducing happiness and measuring problem solving, support these findings. For example, people in whom positive affect has been induced are shown to excel in solving problems requiring ingenuity such as [Duncker’s candle task](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle_problem). The task involves finding a way to fix a lit candle to a cork board in a way so the candle wax won’t drip onto the floor below, using only a book of matches and a box of thumbtacks. The solution requires having the ingenuity to see that the box holding the thumbtacks as a useful component in itself, which can be tacked to the wall and the candle placed inside. The fact that increased positive emotion correlates with an increased success rate on such a test suggests that when we’re happy we’re more able to think innovatively and creatively to solve a problem.

There’s a proposed neuropsychological basis for the impact of positive affect on areas of cognition, based on evidence that periods of mild positive emotion coincide with an increase in brain dopamine levels, and that increased levels of dopamine in the brain may lead to improvements in cognition (8).This model might also complement the ideas discussed above if psychological resources and dopamine are related.

###Happy people are more inclined towards helping others###

Many studies have reported that positive emotions promote helping and generosity. Whilst in my last post I noted that people who volunteer tend to be happier than those who don’t, the reverse also seems to be true: happy people are more inclined to do things like volunteer, donate to charity, or help someone pick up dropped papers.(9) For example, if you make people feel happy by, say, leaving a coin in a payphone for them to find or giving them cookies whilst studying in the library, they’re more likely to help you out when you ask them. (10)

###If we enjoy our job, we’re less likely to burn out###

Another point worth mentioning is that we’re more likely to stick with a job which satisfies us for longer - so the contribution we make will be greater. A meta-analysis of studies linking job dissatisfaction with mental health found the strongest relationship with burnout (as compared with depression, anxiety and self-esteem).(11) We’ll look at the problem of burnout in more detail in a later post.

###Conclusion###

All this implies that it’s more important for the effective altruist to consider his or her own happiness in a career than we might think. Since increased levels of happiness have been shown to increase both productivity (effectiveness) and helping others (altruism), having a satisfying career should be a key component of being an effective altruist in life. Making a difference helps us to be happy - but happy people may also make more difference. The extent to which a career makes a difference, and to which it makes us happy, are therefore more closely connected than they seem - but are separately important. In upcoming posts I’ll discuss in more detail the problems stemming from focusing too much on our own happiness in career choice, and how to deal with this without discounting happiness as a factor altogether.

(4) A comprehensive review of 300 studies determined that when correlations are corrected for the effects of sampling and measurement errors, the average true score correlation between job satisfaction and performance is 0.30: Judge, Thoresen, Bono and Patton, (2001) “The job satisfaction - job performance relationship”, Psychological Bulletin, 127, 376-407 -

(5) A study of 7,939 businesses in 36 companies demonstrated a significant relationship at the business-unit level between employee satisfaction and business-unit outcomes: Harter, James K.; Schmidt, Frank L.; Hayes (2002), “Business-unit-level relationship between employee satisfaction, employee engagement, and business outcomes: A meta-analysis.” Journal of Applied Psychology, Vol 87(2), 268-279

(6) Of course it’s entirely plausible that this might happen in some cases, leading to no change or even a decrease in productivity. Intuitively this might correspond to cases where an increase in happiness, caused for example by excitement about something unrelated to work, causes a decrease in concentration thus affecting productivity.

Feed My Starving Children relies on volunteers in the US to package meals that are sent to nearly 70 countries. This strategy—use labour from a high-wage country to pack food that is then shipped to far-flung regions of the world, at great cost and without improving regional agriculture—seems suboptimal. But the organisation, [with a budget of $25.1 million and 92 new staff members hired in the most recent year](http://www.fmsc.org/document.doc?id=316), seems to be doing well.

</br>
<center><a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/29/original/FeedMyStarvingChildren.jpg?1348530477'><img alt="Feedmystarvingchildren" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/29/medium/FeedMyStarvingChildren.jpg?1348530477" /></a></center>
</br>

This example illustrates one problem with volunteer labour: since volunteers are unpaid, charities have an incentive to recruit them as long as they contribute _some_ value to the charity. In the case of Feed My Starving Children, not only are volunteers unpaid; they're a source of revenue. Feed My Starving Children don’t recruit volunteers in the US for their adept food-handling skills or their convenient location: they recruit them to attract donations, which volunteers are encouraged to make.

Clearly, the effectiveness of a charity is a primary consideration in determining whether you should volunteer for it. But once you’ve found a highly effective charity that’s recruiting volunteers, how do you know whether the work you’re being asked to do is a good use of your time?

One way to get a handle on this problem is to ask the charity whether they would prefer that you complete a certain assignment or that you make a donation. When you find out the amount that you would have to give to the charity for them to be indifferent to whether they receive the donation or have the assignment completed, you have a good estimate of how much the assignment is worth to the charity. This information can help you decide whether to volunteer or donate. For example, if 80,000 Hours would rather have had this post than a donation equal to the value of the time I spent writing it, and they do, volunteering was the better choice—and vice versa.

This technique isn’t perfect. It relies on the knowledge of somebody within the charity—somebody who might also lack a clear idea of what your work is worth. The person you ask might give you an artificially high estimate of the value of your work to avoid hurting your feelings. But somebody from the charity probably will have a better idea of how important the work is and how much it would cost to hire someone to do it. And if you make a charity choose between your money and your time, you are likely to get an honest answer that will help you decide what to do.

******

Another example of a organisation for which volunteers were a source of revenue was FORGE, which [experienced a decline in donations](http://blog.givewell.org/2008/11/12/is-volunteering-just-a-show/) when it reduced its reliance on volunteers.

[80,000 Hours](http://80000hours.org/volunteer) and [Giving What We Can](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/getting-involved/volunteering.php) are looking for [volunteers](/volunteer), and they’d love to have you help (though they might prefer your money). More volunteer opportunities are linked to on [80,000 Hour’s job board](http://80000hours.org/job-board). These organisations do assume that volunteers are more likely to get enthusiastic enough about their ideas to persuade friends and family to join. But they also have a lot of research and community-building tasks that relatively inexperienced volunteers can do very effectively, which makes volunteering for them much more effective than many other charities. And, as you can imagine, one of those research tasks is working out exactly how much value each volunteer contributes. ]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>_</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2012-10-17 12:45:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>703</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Patrick Brinich-Langlois</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>pbrinichlanglois@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/patrick-brinich-langlois</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-11-09 01:39:14</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You are absolutely right that volunteer labor isn't free.

Career choice is complex. There are a lot of uncertainties. This means we [can't necessarily just trust our intuitions](http://80000hours.org/blog/109-should-we-stop-interviewing-people) on what job to choose. What can we do instead?

One suggestion might be to use some kind of *decision rule* to help us. A large body of research suggests that rules can improve decision making in other areas, so this idea is worth paying attention to. However, it’s unclear how reliable these studies are, or how similar the cases in question are to career choice. 

Before we can draw any strong conclusions about the use of rules in career choice, therefore, we need to either test this directly, or do a more detailed survey of the literature (or both.)

##Decision rules in interviews


Earlier I talked about [the problems with interviews.](http://80000hours.org/blog/109-should-we-stop-interviewing-people) They encourage decisions based on *global impressions*, which can be overly influenced by factors such as likeability and attractiveness. But we probably don’t want to stop interviewing people altogether. Interviews are an efficient and flexible way of assessing candidates. If used more effectively, they can be a valuable part of the recruitment process. 

Research into different interviewing methods suggests that we *can* improve the accuracy of interviews. The biggest and most consistent gains come from the use of structured interviews.[^1],[^2] The main idea is to design questions before the interview to test for certain characteristics, develop a way of scoring the answers, and treat all candidates identically.

Why are structured interviews so much better than unstructured ones? The explanation seems to be that they direct focus onto relevant factors and away from irrelevant (or less important) ones. So decisions are less likely to be swayed by something like how immediately likeable a candidate is.  

##Should we use formulas to make our decisions for us?


In recent psychology literature there’s been a fair amount of attention paid to the idea that decision rules may be able to make better predictions than humans. The success of structuring interviews seems to fit in with this. A number of studies across different areas have compared the predictions made by experts with those made by simple formulas. Examples include predicting parole outcomes, the future grades of students, the longevity of cancer patients and the chances of success for a new business. In a meta-analysis of over 100 studies, around half show that the formulas make significantly better predictions. The remainder (bar a very small handful) show a tie.[^3] This doesn’t mean experts are completely useless. There’s a common thread in all these cases: a large amount of uncertainty and poor feedback on whether the decision was a good one or not. Studies show that when feedback is good, expert intuitions can sometimes be very accurate: I’ll be talking about this more in my next post.


When there are a lot of different factors involved and the situation is very uncertain, a simple formula wins out by focusing on the important factors - whilst people may try to “think outside the box” and get swayed by irrelevant considerations. Formal approaches also have the virtue of consistency: give them the same input and they’ll give you the same output every time. This is something people are surprisingly bad at: experienced radiologists rating x-rays as “normal” or “abnormal” contradict themselves a shocking 20% of the time! [^4] 

These results have, unsurprisingly, been met with a fair amount of hostility. They seem to completely undermine the expertise of professionals all over the place, from medicine to courts of law. However, if these studies are to be trusted, simple formulas could be incredibly useful. A well-thought-out formula might save us a great deal of time and effort in making decisions. If it means improving the decisions of doctors, in some cases it might even save lives.

##A formula for the perfect job?

Here’s a thought: **if decision rules can improve the accuracy of interviews, of predicting parole outcomes, of patient diagnosis, might they help us with our career decisions**? 

Intuitively this seems plausible: choosing the best career has a number of things in common with choosing the best candidate for a job. There are a lot of different factors to consider. It’s hard to predict the outcome of your decision. We don’t tend to get good, quick feedback on whether our choice was a good one. The success of structured interviews suggests that we can improve decisions by explicitly thinking about what the most relevant factors are, having some way of scoring these factors, and building this into our decision process. The studies comparing human judgements with formulas also seem to confirm this.

But we have to be careful about what we conclude here just because it “seems plausible”. There are a few things we need to think about:

1) **If formulas are so great, why don’t we use them more?**

Why aren’t structured interviews common practice if they’re so much better at predicting job success? When scientific evidence goes against common sense, we need to ask whether we’re interpreting the evidence correctly, or otherwise explain how we could have got it so wrong.

Kahneman suggests that we're biased against formulas because they seem forced and superficial.[^5] Human judgement, on the other hand, is seen as much more holistic and natural. Malcolm Gladwell puts it nicely:

*“For most of us, hiring someone is essentially a romantic process, in which the job interview functions as a desexualized version of a date. We are looking for someone with whom we have a certain chemistry, even if the coupling that results ends in tears and the pursuer and the pursued turn out to have nothing in common. We want the unlimited promise of a love affair. The structured interview, by contrast, seems to offer only the dry logic and practicality of an arranged marriage.”*[^6]

Another point is that people just don't like admitting they might be wrong. Suggesting to experts that their years of experience could be beaten by a simple calculation is unlikely to go down well, at least at first. However, Atul Gawande suggests in A Checklist Manifesto that mistakes in judgement tend to arise not from errors of *ignorance* but errors of *ineptitude*: it’s not that clinicians don’t have a lot of relevant knowledge, they just don’t know the best ways to apply it. So we needn’t see formulas or checklists as threatening: it’s not that they show us what we don’t know, but rather help us to make better use of what we do know.[^7]

2) **How reliable are these studies?**

It’s not entirely clear how fair these comparisons between rules and experts are. There’s been some scepticism about the reliability of these results: for some discussion see the comments on [this article](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gv/statistical_prediction_rules_outperform_expert/). 

[Ashenfelter’s study](http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Ashenfelter-Bordeaux-Wine-Vintage-Quality-and-the-Weather.pdf), for example, is often quoted as showing that a simple algorithm can do a much better job than wine tasting experts when predicting future prices of Bordeaux wine. But if we look closer at the study itself there doesn’t seem to be any direct comparison between the formula and expert’s predictions: the formula’s predictions are just compared with market prices. It’s also not clear that the outcome of these predictions has been measured over a long enough period of time. 

There are a number of questions we need to ask here. Do the rules and experts use the same information? Is it relatively easy to come up with a prediction rule like this, or do the studies just show that there *exists* a rule that beats experts after multiple attempts? How is the success of the different predictions being measured? 

3) **How similar are these studies to career choice?**

In many of the documented cases, there’s already a lot of detailed expert knowledge: medical diagnosis being one such example. So it might be that the rules do better by codifying this knowledge in a simpler way. [Apgar’s test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apgar_score), for example, was a simple rule that improved the diagnosis of newborns dramatically and saved thousands of lives. However, Apgar needed a lot of experience to know what factors needed to be scored by the test. I’m not sure that that we have enough experience or knowledge when it comes to career choice to come up with a rule that could improve our decisions in the same way.

4) **Do we know enough about the factors that influence our career decisions?**

Not any old rule will do. A formula developed by an expert with a lot of experience is very different from one that you or I might just come up with ourselves. The formulas that make the best predictions are ones which use information we know is *valid* for the outcome we’re trying to predict. A formula designed to test the chances of success of a marriage needs to measure things which we know are actually relevant when it comes to predicting marriage success. Frequency of quarrels: yes, difference in height: probably not. This might sound obvious, but sometimes it's just really hard to know what the relevant factors are. 

We may not know enough yet about career choice: there’s no cut-and-dried account yet of what the most important things to think about are. It also depends what exactly we’re trying to predict or measure. If we’re just looking for a job we’ll love, a rule scoring careers based on these [predictors of job satisfaction](http://80000hours.org/blog/68-how-to-find-a-job-you-ll-love) might be useful. There's a fair amount of research that tells us these predictors are pretty good. But if we’re looking for a “perfect” job on multiple levels: one we’ll enjoy, be great at, and really makes a difference, coming up with a formula to predict this might be a bit harder!

##Conclusion

That decision rules could improve career decisions seems worth looking into further: it seems plausible, and could be really very useful if true. But before we can reach any conclusions, we need to either a) **have reliable evidence that formulas can improve decisions in other comparable situations** or b) **get some direct evidence that formulas actually improve career decisions.**

It therefore seems like we need to do a more detailed survey of the literature on formal prediction procedures. This could also produce some really important and useful implications for a number of areas besides career choice. 

Testing the use of decision rules in career choice directly also seems like a good idea, to get a better idea of how useful they are and what the important factors are. We’re planning on doing this by putting together some simple prediction models and testing them in our advice sessions. So hopefully we’ll be able to offer some more practical advice soon. If you’d like to help us with this, and see if you can improve your career decisions at the same time, we’d love to hear from you!

You develop the ideas very clearly.

I agree that it's tricky to use a formula here because we don't yet have studies telling us what the relevant factors are to look for. Until we have a set of inputs and weights that we know works (and is more than just overfitting of existing data sets), then either (a) we might make up something that feels arbitrary and go with it even though it doesn't  have a track record of being successful, or (b) we could choose what we wanted to do anyway by gerrymandering the inputs and weights to our favor. It might feel more rational to use a formula, but if we're just making up factors out of thin air, that's not obviously better than the global synthesizing that the neural networks in our brains would do, unless we have reason to suspect being biased by particular irrelevant factors (like attractiveness for non-public-facing careers).]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Quantum Quest: Pruning Procrastination</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/84-quantum-quest-pruning-procrastination</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[<center><a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/23/original/quantum_physics.jpg?1348444290'><img alt="Quantum_physics" class="image medium" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/23/medium/quantum_physics.jpg?1348444290" /></a></center>

In a series of posts, I will offer a perspective on the “quantum quest” - the evolving attempt to make tomorrow better than today. Changing the world is certainly a quest. And while the evolution may appear to be smooth and continuous, it happens in discrete steps – hence the “quantum”.
             
###Productivity and Effectiveness###

80,000 Hours has focused on how you can change the world through your career. This post is a lead-in to a series of posts aiming to complement the deliberation on [career choice](http://80000hours.org/your-career) with thoughts about how to be more productive and effective in the paths we end up pursuing (which can be applied more generally to other areas of your life).

If you have altruistic goals, then boosting your effectiveness helps you make more difference, sometimes a lot more. We may spend about 80,000 hours in a typical career, while the time available in a longer-than-typical life (for now) is probably on the order of 800,000 hours – which of course includes plenty of time for sleep!

             
###Goals, Plans, Methods###

How do productivity and effectiveness fit into the big picture? There are three broad stages in purposeful action – starting with goals, make a plan, then execute actions with methods.

Increased productivity does not obviate the need to identify goals to focus on, as it will never be possible to have the time or resources to do everything you want to do. You have to decide what you *really* want, which is tricky to say the least.

A plan is a set of actions leading to a goal. Better plans make the goal more likely to be attained. Plans are also tricky because they form the bridge between reality and dream, a hypothetical link between what is practical and what is possible.

The focus of this post is methods. Methods are the nitty-gritty of what gets things done, and are literally what you have to do to make things happen. Boosting the productivity and effectiveness of your methods will serve the cause of your plans and goals.
        
###Procrastination###

The first stumbling block to any method is not applying the method. Dealing with the psychology of procrastination is therefore a key step in understanding effectiveness. The rest of this post will point you towards ways to prune your procrastination.

I procrastinated about writing this post, so I thought I’d tell you about some of the methods I used, based on the best resources I found, to get myself to finish it!

[Luke Muehlhauser](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3w3/how_to_beat_procrastination/) gives a gentle introduction to the field of temporal motivational theory. The converse of procrastination is motivation, and a simple, experimentally validated theoretical framework from the [literature](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/133/1/65.html) (1) takes the approximate form of,

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/21/original/procrastination-equation.png?1346406103'><img alt="Procrastination-equation" height="99" width="548" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/21/original/procrastination-equation.png" /></a> 

which really just means that to increase motivation, do one or more of the following

**Expectancy**: increase your chances of succeeding at the task<br/>
**Value**: increase the subjective value of the task to you<br/>
**Impulsiveness**: decrease your impulsiveness and distractions<br/>
**Delay**: decrease the time delay of the task reward<br/>

In coming up with this blog post, the issue of _scope_ was critical. By telling myself to start small and focus on “getting out the door”, I set myself a target that was more easily achieved, and which would set me up for a progression to greater targets in future. This concept is called [success spirals](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/258790) (2). Think of it like nudging a ball sitting at the top of a hill: it starts to move slowly and picks up speed once it gains some momentum. Success spirals work by leading to increased _expectancy_. By starting small, you build up your belief that the tasks are manageable, increasing your chances of handling the next task (as long as you stay grounded, and don’t let success blind you to potential problems). The other nice thing about initially embarking on a success spiral is that breaking up a task into smaller chunks naturally [decreases _delay_](http://www.jstor.org/stable/20159257) (3) as the smaller chunk will materialise sooner.
             
Finding a supportive community was another important strategy to facilitate writing. By bouncing my ideas off [Ben Todd](http://80000hours.org/members/benjamin-todd) and Mark Lee of [Leverage Research](http://www.leverageresearch.org/), I not only got useful feedback and comments, but also the discipline of internal deadlines for drafts, which helps enormously with decreasing [_impulsiveness_](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6042052) (4).

There are also ways to fight procrastination before it can make the first move. By positioning this post as the first in a series of posts on the “quantum quest”, I'm also committing myself to future work that [increases the _value_](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/rev/99/2/248.html)(5) of this first post, which I need to release into the wild in order to pave the way for more posts. And such positioning also helps in the future with decreasing _impulsiveness_.

###Thoughts?###

Do you have some favourite ways of beating procrastination?

Help to steer the “quantum quest”. What areas of productivity and effectiveness are you interested to hear about? Personal development? Skills-building? Software/computer-related stuff? Information management?

The world is changing as we speak. The growth of groups like 80,000 Hours and [THINK](http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/) in the “effective altruism” space is exciting. Will you get involved?

----------------------------

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/51/original/interview-tips.gif?1351244764'><img alt="Interview-tips" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/51/large/interview-tips.gif?1351244764" /></a>
*Would you hire this guy?*

Most employers rely heavily on interviews in recruiting. However, there's evidence that the method of choosing candidates based on general impressions from an interview is **barely more accurate than a coin toss.**[^1] Evaluations of interviews conducted in the Israeli Defence Forces to assign soldiers to various branches, for example, suggested that the procedure was almost completely useless at predicting the future success of recruits. [^2]

Multiple studies indicate that the interview process is **far from perfect** : that **interview performance is a poor predictor of job performance** [^3], and that it’s often **overvalued relative to other assessment methods** (such as aptitude tests and references) [^4]. This is pretty worrying when we think about how much difference hiring the best candidate for an important job can make. It might sound crazy, but maybe we should stop interviewing people...

##Why can interviewing lead to bad hiring decisions? 

Judging which candidate has the best chance of success in a job is far from easy. We have to consider a huge number of different factors and then combine them together in the right way. This is difficult even in theory, let alone in practice! This means interviewers tend to rely on shortcuts to make their decisions.

There’s a more general problem being highlighted here. **When faced with uncertainty, people often resort to following their intuitions: which can lead to bad decisions.**

##Going with your gut

Interviews encourage “going with your gut” - hiring the candidate who just “feels right.” Evidence suggests that interviewers often make decisions in the first few minutes of meeting a candidate! [^5] And lasting impressions of candidates can massively influence the decisions that are made post-interview. 

This is partly explained by what’s known as the [affect heuristic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_heuristic): we tend to let our emotions influence our decisions more than perhaps we should. Rather than attempt to answer the difficult question “Which candidate will be better at the job?”, many people instead opt to answer the much simpler one, “Which candidate do I like more?” But the most likeable candidate isn’t always the one who’ll do the job best.

##Who would you hire?

Suppose you’re looking to fill a postdoctoral position in a high impact research area like vaccine development. The search has been narrowed down to the following two candidates:

1. Sarah has just completed her PhD. She gave a sparkling and enthusiastic interview performance, blowing everyone away. However, she has no substantial track record of productive research.

2. Ruth has held a postdoctoral research position for the past three years. She has been incredibly productive during this time, and her research record is excellent. However, her interview performance was less sparkling than Sarah’s and she came across as very shy.

Who would you choose? For many people, intuition favours Sarah. She left a stronger impression and was more likeable; it’s hard not to be swayed by this. So let’s say you give the position to Sarah. You’re disappointed to find that once she starts her research, she’s not quite as exceptional as you thought she might be. (Although you should really have predicted this, if you knew anything about [regression toward the mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean)) Her inexperience means it takes her a while to get into the swing of research. She does a pretty good job regardless, helping to develop a vaccine which ends up saving hundreds of lives per year.

What if you’d hired Ruth instead? Perhaps you were put off by her shyness initially. However, you probably would have soon realised it didn’t matter much in research. Her experience would probably have made her slightly more productive than Sarah, and she wouldn’t have needed the same time to get into the swing of things [^6]. So she might have sped up the development of the vaccine by, say, a couple of months. This may not seem like a huge difference, but it might mean saving an extra 50 odd lives. No big deal?

##The danger of first impressions

Not only can they be vastly inaccurate, but first impressions can [taint any further judgements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect) we make of someone. If our first impression of someone is good, we’re more likely to rate them highly in other ways. Sarah’s immediate likeability may mean we judge her as more motivated and hardworking than she really is, for example.

##The problem with gut judgements

Choosing who to hire is hard because we can’t be sure how accurately we’ve judged each candidate, or predict who will really do the best job. What makes it even harder is that it may be months or even years down the line until we can tell whether our decision was a good one or not. So we can’t even learn from mistakes very easily.

There are a lot of situations like this in everyday life: where it’s hard to predict things because there’s so much to consider, and it’s a long time before we’ll know whether we were right or not. Other examples include predicting:

* your grades at the end of the year
* how likely a new business is to succeed
* how likely criminals are to reoffend
* who’ll win the football match
* how much that bottle of Bordeaux will be worth in a few years

There’s a lot of evidence that “gut feelings” aren’t much use in situations like this [^7]. There’s just **too much uncertainty and unpredictability.** (More accurately, we can use our gut, but we have to be careful how we do it - we'll talk about this in the next couple of posts)

##What does this mean for your career?

**Choosing a career** has a lot in common with the examples given above. There are a lot of different factors to consider, a huge number of unknowns, and it can be a long time before we get any kind of feedback on whether our decision was a good one or not. **So we’d expect our intuitions to be similarly unreliable.** In the next few posts I'll discuss:

+ Why a simple model might sometimes be better
+ When going with your gut might still be useful 
+ What all this means for your career decisions

This then links to my broader point, of how it can be dangerous to opt for shortcuts when faced with difficult decisions.

It's also worth noting that a small difference in how well you get on with a an employee will probably translate, at most, to a small difference in output in terms of the work they produce.

I was wondering if there was any more fine-grained stuff on what careers interview performance served as a better predictor in? I would guess interview performance might serve as a (albeit not great) measure of inter-personal skills which might be the key skill for sales/fundraising/other stuff. Also, there's been a move (at least in medicine) towards structured or semi-structured interviews, so I wonder if these might do better. All that said, I wouldn't be too surprised if interviewing had no value 'across the board'.

I'd imagine there are also careerist take-homes too. If climbing the job/scientific/whatever hierarchy is important to making a high impact, one can pick fields and companies accordingly: if you know you are the best, it is worth going for places that focus on objective measures when hiring (and vice-versa!) It would also suggest that focusing on 'interview skills' (whatever they are) may well have more instrumental value than actual achievements.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>691</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Benjamin Todd</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>benjamin.john.todd@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/benjamin-todd</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-11-04 16:46:06</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It's also pretty unclear to me that interviews are a good way of judging whether you'll be able to get on with someone in the long-term, though it looks like a better thing to assess through interviews than most, especially if you go into it with that intention.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>694</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Richard Batty</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>rjlbatty@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/richard-batty</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-11-05 10:56:00</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I wonder if it's inadvisable to train too much for interviews - if you end up getting a job with more responsibility than you can handle that might be a lot worse than getting a job that fits closely with your skills.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>693</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Jess Whittlestone</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>jess.whittlestone@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/jess-whittlestone</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-11-04 21:03:11</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for your comments Greg!

James Taylor once said, “Time will take your money, but money won’t buy time.”  I don’t think that’s entirely accurate.  Yes, no matter how much you are willing to pay, you won’t be able to get more than 24 hours in a day.  However, most of us can at least in theory pay money to free up more time for the things we like doing–whether that is pursuing an effective career that makes a difference, or going for long wild swims.  

If you are money rich and time poor, for example because you you have a demanding career, then you could probably benefit from trading some money for time.

In this post I will begin by discussing someone who is one of my biggest time-savers.  Her name is Amber, and she is my virtual assistant.  

##Virtual assistance

I use a virtual assistant (VA) extensively, and she is one of my favourite ways to convert money into time.  Amber, my VA, does a wide range of tasks for me.  Here are just a few tasks that she does for me:

- Diary management – Amber manages much of my professional schedule.  She schedules all of my professional meetings and sorts out booking for restaurants to have evening meetings in.  She also sends a reminder to the person I am meeting, and enters the meeting into my [google calendar](http://www.google.com/calendar/) which I sync with my iCal automatically via [Spanning Sync](http://spanningsync.com/).  She also fills out [doodles](http://www.doodle.com/) that I’ve been asked to respond to.  I have a long rule set that Amber follows, meaning that she never has to ask me any questions about scheduling or locations.

- Train booking – I used to put train booking on my task management system, but the prices would go up and I would waste both money and time booking it myself nearer the time.  Now that I have a VA, Amber just books them for me given certain constraints.  Again, I have a long and complex rule set for Amber to follow.  This saves her asking me any questions.  

- Buying things – most things can be found online cheaper than in a shop, so that even once you factor in postage fees, VA time, and my delegation time, it is still cheaper for me to ask Amber to order things online than for me to order them myself.

- Product research – One of the nice things about using a virtual assistant is that I can describe something that I want that isn’t easy to locate in a google search.  For example, my father asked for a giant redwood tree sapling for his birthday.  While there are plenty of these available in California, a quick Google search does not bring up any in the UK.  Amber is able to phone around various nurseries, find one for me, order it, and have it delivered to my Dad’s house all for a few pounds, saving me at least half an hour of my time.  

- Online research – For example, finding me the best bank account or driving school

- Transcription – In some situations, it is easier for me to make notes by voice recording or on paper.  I send these off to Amber for her to transcribe, and let her know who to send them to when she is done.  [Evernote](http://evernote.com/) is a great cross-platform tool that lets me do this easily, as it accepts both voice recordings and photos as input, so I can just take photos of notes and send them to Amber.  

- Edits – I find that I spot more things to edit on hard copies of documents than I do reading the same document on screen.  It’s much quicker for me to auto-scan the document with mark-ups and send it to Amber than it is for me to make the edits myself.  

- Trip planning – Amber is quite good at researching and booking trips for me.  I send her a number of requirements on the accommodation, activities, distance from Oxford, etc., and she sorts out the details.  She finds flights and books all transport from rental cards to coaches.  This does take more back-and-forth than most interactions that I have with Amber, but this is almost always because I have defined my preferences poorly.  The biggest thing that Amber coordinated was my girlfriend’s birthday trip to the coast.  She sorted out a week when everyone was free, found an ideal location on the coast, booked accommodation for eight people, sorted out car hire and liaised with the driver of our group, found a place to hire wetsuits and surf boards, logged expenses, followed up with everyone who hadn’t paid me back for their share of the trip within a month, and even arranged for a paddling pool, hose and connectors to be delivered to the house so that we could create a make-shift hot tub, all from the comfort of her home.  Coordinating all of this took one long email and about a dozen shorter emails from me.  I’d imagine that next time we’d be able to get it down to just a handful of emails as I learn how to delegate better.  

- Recruitment – I also asked Amber to manage the recruitment process for the [World Economic Forum’s London Shapers’ Hub](http://www.weforum.org/videos/global-shapers-london-hub).  She processed applications from applicants, responded to dozens of questions from applications via an FAQ that I wrote for her, and did lots of matching and formatting of CVs, multiple nominations per applicant and applications.  She even negotiated deadline extensions on my behalf with former prime minister Gordon Brown’s office and with former secretary of state Peter Mandelson.  I was very pleased with the results.  

- Emails – According to Tim Ferris, who helped popularise virtual assistants, the holy grail of outsourcing is to outsource your inbox.  I experimented with having Amber sort my mail into things I needed to read and things I didn’t.  But once I unsubscribed myself from all of the mail lists I didn’t need to read, and asked various friends and family members who emailed me lots of chain mail to stop, I didn’t need her to keep sorting my mail so she stopped.  Nonetheless Tim’s [blog post on this subject](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2008/01/21/the-holy-grail-how-to-outsource-the-inbox-and-never-check-email-again/) opened my eyes to the possibility of outsourcing significant parts of my life, and is worth reading. 

- Social media – This isn’t my style, but I’ve heard of people using virtual assistants to manage their social media and online personas.  This is just one of many ways that you can hire a VA to represent you online.  

- Etc. – Amber also pays many of my bills, researches the biographies of people who I am going to meet, sifts through lists of conference attendees to find people who I should meet, and any other tasks that I feel I can delegate to her.  

For more information on how virtual assistants, including how to find one and how to manage him/her, see [Tim Ferris’ blog.](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/category/outsourcing-life/)

For what it is worth, I have tried one assistant from timesvr.com, who required several follow-ups for him to complete any task, and I tried rent-a-smile, which was good and punctual, but I got a different person to respond to each request so I couldn’t have them learn my rule sets like Amber has.  Amber is the sister of a friend, and is happy to work for me while she finished her studies.  She has learned my preferences, and also doesn’t have trouble understanding requests that include cultural nuances, and she seems generally more competent than anyone who I have tried previously.  

So virtual assistants can help you free up significant chunks of time, but it really helps to find a particular person who you can trust.

It implies that your career hinges on one single decision: what you should do with the rest of your life. It’s no wonder that choosing a career can seem daunting!

In reality, you needn’t choose one career path and stick with it blindly for the rest of your life. Career choice is less a single decision, and more a sequence of smaller decisions. You make a best guess of what to do next, try things out, test and learn, and then reassess. Thinking of each individual decision like this takes a huge amount of pressure off: you don’t need to choose perfectly first time.

Drawing on [similarities between an individual planning their career and a startup business](http://80000hours.org/blog/237-your-career-is-like-a-startup), we’ve realised the importance of focusing on learning and adapting to change early on in your career. We’ve come to the conclusion that [rigid career plans probably aren’t that helpful, and could even be harmful - but you do still need some means of direction and motivation for the future](http://80000hours.org/blog/164-should-you-plan-your-career).

One promising solution to all this is the idea of having a “career model”: identifying your aims and values, and making a best guess of how you might achieve them. What’s key is that the model is designed to be tested and adapted as you learn. In this post I'll outline the career model we use at 80,000 Hours, explain how we've come to this model, and then go into the various parts of the model in more detail.

#Overview of our career model

**Have a vision**

1. **Values:** what do you ultimately care about?
2. **Cause:** what problem in the world do you want to work towards solving?
3. **Mission:** what’s your best guess of what you could do long term to solve it?

**Using this vision to guide your next steps**

1. **Route mapping**: what are some possible routes to your mission?
2. **Ways to assess your next steps:** what skills, experience and networks do these routes require?
3. **Best guess next step:** what could you do next that would help you to progress towards your mission? 

**Making progress**

1. What are your greatest key uncertainties?
2. Which of these can most easily be resolved?
3. **Learning goals:** What are you going to do, or what information are you going to seek, to improve your career plan?

#How have we come up with this career model?

We started off initially thinking about the best strategies for choosing between different career options. However, we soon realised that this approach was far too one-dimensional: in order to choose between the options immediately in front of you, you need to have some idea of where you’re hoping they’ll take you. This got us started thinking about the importance of identifying your ultimate aims and values, and planning for the future.

As I wrote about [previously](http://80000hours.org/blog/164-should-you-plan-your-career), the problem with planning is that the world is constantly changing, and the job market will look very different in 10 years’ time. We started looking into business strategy literature and research, finding [good reason to believe this could help inform career planning strategy](startup post). These insights provided the basis for the concept of a “career model.”

The specific kind of career model we’re recommending builds on this basic concept given our ideas about what factors are important, and how they fit together in an easy to use framework.

We then started explicitly testing these ideas out in careers advising sessions and workshops, by presenting people with our career model idea and helping them to work through it for their own decisions. This allowed us to get feedback on how useful people found this structure, how easy it was to adapt to different situations, and how we might improve it. We spent several days discussing the feedback we’d received in different settings with one another and what changes this might suggest. As a result, the basic structure of the “career model” has gone through several iterations. 

There may not be a “one size fits all”, and we almost certainly need to test and adapt this further, but we’ve found that the following is a useful structure for thinking about your career.

#In more depth: further explanation of the career model
</br>
##Have a vision
</br>

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/213/original/vision.jpg?1376058991'><img alt="Vision" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/213/large/vision.jpg?1376058991" /></a>

If you want to make a difference, you need to think not only about your next steps, but also where your career might be headed in the future. [Having a vision for the future can be incredibly motivating](http://80000hours.org/blog/164-should-you-plan-your-career), as well as helping you to identify opportunities and ensure you’re headed in the right direction.[^1] We’ve got good reason to think that some [causes](http://80000hours.org/causes) and [careers](http://80000hours.org/blog/94-how-to-do-one-year-of-work-in-four-hours) are many times more effective than others, so having some way to assess where your steps in the present are taking you is incredibly important.

The problem, of course, is that the future is highly uncertain. It’s very difficult to predict what the world will need, and what the job market will look like, in ten or twenty years’ time. This means that rigid plans for the future aren’t that useful and are more likely to hinder than help, by narrowing your focus too soon.[^2], [^3] At the same time, you can’t ignore the future entirely. So what should you do?

Having some kind of long-term “vision” can be a good way to guide your progress and keep you focused, as long as you’re open to changing it. 

We think a good vision has three components:

1) **Your values**

*What does a flourishing world look like to you? What do you ultimately care about?*

If you want to make the world a better place, you need some idea of what a “better” world would actually look like! An understanding of your values provides you with the standards you need to evaluate everything else. 

2) **Your cause**

*What problem in the world are you going to work towards solving? Why do you think this is a particularly promising cause?*

Understanding your values is important, but these tend to be too abstract to help much in day to day career planning. Identifying a cause: some problem in the world you might work towards solving, starts to bridge this gap between what you care about and what you might actually *do.*

3) **Your mission**

*What are you actually going to do in the long term to solve this problem? *

It’s hard to be motivated to solve a problem without some idea of what you could actually *do* - both now and in the long term - to solve it. This means thinking about both (a) what the most effective ways to work on your cause might be and (b) which of these ways *you* might be best suited to.

These questions are complex, and you shouldn’t expect to settle them. Instead, thinking them through allows you to make a current best guess that you revisit and change as you learn more. 

##Use this vision to guide your next steps
</br>
<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/215/original/next_steps_content.png?1376059351'><img alt="Next_steps_content" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/215/large/next_steps_content.png?1376059351" /></a>

1) **What are the possible routes to achieving your mission?**

Having a vision is all very well, but it’s useless unless you have some way of translating it into action. And sometimes it can be difficult to see how long term plans relate to next steps that you can take in the present. However, with a best guess long-term mission in hand, which should be a concrete idea of a job or position you’d like to be in, you can start thinking about the path you’d need to follow to get there. 

One useful way to start is to try to find either a) existing jobs or roles that are close to your mission, or b) specific people who have achieved something similar. For existing roles or jobs, you can then start doing research into what qualifications and skills they need: by looking at job descriptions and application requirements, for example. For specific people, try to find out what their career paths looked like: by speaking to them if at all possible, or looking at their biographies or CVs.

2) **What do these routes have in common?**

Once you’ve identified different possible routes to your mission, you can start to recognise patterns and similarities. What kinds of skills, experience and networks come up as important or even essential to getting to where you want to be in the long term? 

3) **Using this to make a best guess next step**

Having a better understanding of what kinds of skills and experience will be most useful for you to focus on building provides you with a set of criteria with which to evaluate your next steps.
Slowly, you can start to bridge the gap between where you are in the present, and what you’re aiming for in the long term.

##Making progress
</br>
<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/214/original/progress.jpg?1376059188'><img alt="Progress" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/214/large/progress.jpg?1376059188" /></a>

However, once you've got an idea of your vision and some possible routes to getting there, it's not quite as simple as just executing these steps. As we've highlighted before, the world around you is constantly changing and it's important to be sensitive to and prepared to adapt to these changes. This means being prepared to adapt your model as you learn more.

1) **What are your biggest key uncertainties?**

Ask yourself which parts of your career model you're currently most uncertain about. Where do you feel like you have the least information, and where is additional information most useful to help you?

2) **Which of these can most easily be resolved?**

Sometimes there won't be anything you can do to resolve certain uncertainties right now, so you might have to leave them to come back to later when the situation is different, and focus on those where you can most easily make progress. 

For each of your key uncertainties, ask yourself, "What information would help me to resolve this uncertainty? How might I get such information?" You can then start to prioritise getting new information where it's easiest to find and most useful.

3) **Set learning goals**

You can then set yourself **learning goals**, for what you are going to do or what information you are going to seek to try and improve your career model. 

You should be aiming to repeat this process of identifying key uncertainties, thinking about which can most easily resolved, and then setting learning goals, on a regular basis.

Their approach, up till now, has been mostly of the lamentable [‘fundraising is evil’]( http://80000hours.org/blog/9-it-is-effectiveness-not-overhead-that-matters) variety. 

Despite the fact that the comparison they’ve been making between organisations was only loosely correlated to the effectiveness of the organisation (1), they’ve become one of the most influential forces in charity comparison. According to them, they get almost [3.3mn unique visitors every year]( http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=1193). 

##You can’t beat a good idea

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/57/original/Best_News_photo.jpg?1352397185'><img alt="Image courtesy of freedigitalphotos.net" align="right" class="image medium" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/57/medium/Best_News_photo.jpg?1352397185" /></a> 

[Things are about to change.]( http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=1193) Charity Navigator is taking an aggressive step in the direction of results based charity evaluation. They’re building their capacity, with help from the Hewlett Foundation, to evaluate the results of all the charities they collect information on. 

Even better, once the results rating is live they plan to make it the most significant factor in their evaluations.

## It’s going to be tough

They’ve got a pretty innovative approach. While GiveWell focuses resources on the most promising leads, Charity Navigator seems to want to cover all the charities it looks at. That is potentially wasteful, but maybe they’re betting that their comprehensiveness will give them some extra credibility as well as reach.

They’re planning to base part of their impact assessment on the quantity of feedback the charities get from their beneficiaries. Part will come from teams of trained volunteer charity evaluators, crowd-sourced from universities across the US. And part will come from the professionals - they’re going to incorporate [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org) and [Philanthropedia](http://www.myphilanthropedia.org) rankings. (Philanthropedia effectively [polls informed individuals about the top charities in a sector]( http://www.myphilanthropedia.org/how_we_rank)).

##Why it will be good

More than 3m people make their charitable decisions at least in part based on Charity Navigator’s advice. These people are interested in effective giving, but they’ve been given fairly incomplete advice so far.

While the new ranking system will not be perfect, it will be a huge step in the right direction.
1.	The rankings will be better correlated with cost-effectiveness than the old ones.
2.	By applying a similar methodology to thousands of charities at the same time, we’ll learn a lot about charity comparison.
3.	The ranking system will incentivise charities to get engagement and feedback from beneficiaries.
4.	The rankings will expose millions of people to the idea of results-based charity evaluation.
5.	The volunteer charity evaluators will learn a lot about giving intelligently.

That can only be good for charity.

##Why it probably won’t beat GiveWell

GiveWell’s approach differs from Charity Navigator’s in several key ways. GiveWell, quite rightly, doesn’t feel the need to evaluate every possible lead. They focus on the most promising ones and make sure they explore them thoroughly. That lets them treat charities with a level of nuance that will be very hard to compete with. Even after Charity Navigator turns results-based it may still not have the level of analysis GiveWell boasts. 

But, more than that, Charity Navigator has been committed so far to some ideas about overhead costs that are unhelpful. Charity Navigator says that [“charities exist to provide programmes and services”]( http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=35) and therefore they should spend most of their money on the programmes themselves, and not on overhead. But charities don’t exist to *provide* programmes and services - charities exist to produce results *through* programmes and services. Some things in life are about the journey, not the destination. But, in a world of urgent human suffering, charity is not one of those things. When good management and effective fundraising are the best ways to make people’s lives better, then I expect the charities I fund to make use of them.

##Why I hope it does

The stakes in this game are way too big to leave in one organisation’s hands. The value of information in charity comparison is staggering - making this stuff a common topic of conversation could plausibly lead to the near eradication of global poverty in a few decades. GiveWell has revolutionised the way we do and think about charity comparison. I’m curious to see how far that change can spread.



(1)They’ve been using some measures of financial strength, and more recently accountability and transparency. These are correlated with effectiveness, but not strongly.

  We are now testing a third dimension - results (CN 3.0). The results
  dimension will count for the largest portion of the total rating
  score once it goes live.

What progress has there been on this?  Is it close to ready?

**What were the initial influences that led you to care about doing as much good for the world as possible?**

I grew up in a family that cared about social issues. However, I wasn't terribly interested in them myself until late 2000, when I saw a speech by Ralph Nader at a local college. Nader's speech wasn't just about politics narrowly defined, but also about the extraordinary amounts of suffering (or, in his words, "injustice") in our world and the amazing ability that young people have to make a difference -- especially educated young people living in the most powerful country on the planet. Inspired by Nader's example, I became a really good student, and I led many social-activism clubs and projects at my high school.

Later, in spring 2005, I heard the word ‘utilitarian’ and didn't quite know what it meant, so I looked it up. I was delighted to discover that there was a name for the philosophy of cost-benefit analysis applied to happiness and suffering that I had been following for the last few years. I soon found [utilitarian.net](http://utilitarian.net/) and read Peter Singer's work on animals. Previously I had believed that non-human animals couldn't consciously suffer, but Singer persuaded me otherwise, and it soon became obvious that animal suffering was the most important current issue due to its sheer scale. This is true even when we consider just animals raised for food -- there are ~[24 billion livestock](http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/number-of-wild-animals.html) at any given moment and at least [a trillion fish](http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=544) slaughtered per year – but is even more the case if we count wild animals, which outnumber domestic animals by many orders of magnitude.

**What were the first steps that you took in the direction of effective altruism?**

There's not a black-and-white distinction between effective and less-effective altruism, so I wouldn't say that it began at a single point. During high school, I was really struck by statistics about how the number of preventable deaths due to mundane causes were orders of magnitude higher than deaths due to things like terrorism that people worry so much about.

Around 2005, the altruistic value of money became very clear to me. I remember reading one optimistic estimate that $500 spent on certain HIV-prevention programs could save a life, and similar suggestions were echoed in Singer's writings. I also began thinking about "replaceability'" in career choice -- i.e., that if I get a salary while working at a do-gooder nonprofit, it means someone else won't be filling that role. (The details of replaceability considerations are more elaborate, which is why Benjamin Todd has now written a whole thesis on the subject!) So, while I had originally assumed I would pursue a life as an activist or policy analyst in the future, I began to see the merits of [making money to donate](http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/make-money.html). I talked about these ideas with many friends and wrote an editorial on the subject for my school newspaper, and as it turns out that is what I've ended up doing so far.

**... And what are you doing now?**

After a lot of career exploration and research, I decided I wanted to focus on statistics and machine learning. I'm in the Core Ranking division [of Bing, the Microsoft search engine], which tries to improve the relevance of the ‘ten blue links" (i.e., the main algorithmic search results). Not only is the work interesting (it's a lot like being a scientist, without the messy lab work), but the atmosphere, daily schedule, and culture of the team allow a lot of freedom for me. I even have a treadmill in my office that I use for a few hours a day while working. And the pay is quite good, which is important from the perspective of Earning to Give.

Microsoft has a "matching contributions" program that doubles any donation I make to a tax-deductible charity up to $12K per year. This is one of the more generous matching programs I know of. Each year, I max out this limit by donating to [Vegan Outreach](http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/vegan-outreach.html) and [The Humane League](http://www.thehumaneleague.com/), and sometimes I give a little extra. The remainder of my income that doesn't go toward taxes, rent, food, and other costs of living is divided between donations to a donor-advised fund (so that I can [get more tax deductions without committing to a charity just yet](http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=123)) and buying stocks as personal savings (in case I need to spend money on projects that aren't part of a 501(c)(3) at some point in the future).

**Do you find it difficult to maintain your commitment?**

The answer is "no, I don't find it difficult," but this isn't due to any great powers of will on my part. Caring about the suffering of others and wanting to do something about it just come naturally, for which I'm very lucky. I'm not enticed by material possessions or expensive adventures, and my family was a little bit poor while growing up, so I am naturally frugal.

Reducing suffering has been my main priority in life for ~12 years, and I don't expect the feeling to die away any time soon. That said, you can't always control where your emotions take you, so [it's important](http://reducing-suffering.blogspot.com/2010/04/salience-and-motivation.html) to embed yourself in social and environmental situations that will reinforce your motivation. Becoming friends with like-minded people, such as the members of 80,000 Hours or the contributors to [Felicifia](http://felicifia.org/), can be extremely helpful, both because we learn from each other and we keep each other interested in topics that matter. It can also be useful to build altruism into your personal identity, so that you'll feel more intrinsic motivation toward it and will be less likely to let it go. Donating earlier rather than later can be a good step in this regard -- also because it gets you into the habit of giving and ensures that you don't have loads of spare cash that you might be tempted to spend -- although I recommend considering a donor-advised fund or even private trust [if you expect your wisdom to improve](http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=206#p1578) over the coming years faster than the social rate of return on the donation.

**How do those altruistic efforts intersect with your relationships with friends, family and colleagues, or your other plans in life?**

Activism has definitely enhanced my friendships. Caring about suffering inspired me to talk to lots more people than I would have otherwise, both because (a) it showed me how important it is to learn from other people in order to improve the accuracy of your world-views and (b) talking with others is an opportunity to get them excited about crucial issues. Probably ~200 of my friends on Facebook I've met through nothing other than our shared interest in altruism. I find that with altruism, there's an abundance of fascinating people that I want to meet and talk to about all kinds of topics.

It's interesting how people sometimes struggle to find activities that will allow them to "meet people" (going bowling, hanging out in bars, joining fishing clubs, or whatever), yet I find that with altruism, there's an abundance of fascinating people that I want to meet and talk to about all kinds of topics. I have no trouble starting conversations or feeling engaged with the discussions. As Ralph Nader has said, "sometimes the best social life is a civic life."

Religious and spiritual lecturers often talk about "living for a higher purpose," and I don't doubt that working to reduce suffering taps into the same neural circuits. It's quite possible that I'm happier and more fulfilled than if I had never thought about suffering and was still playing video games. (But probably not too much happier, in light of the [hedonic treadmill](http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/hedonist.htm).)

**I have noticed that online you are extremely courteous and friendly when discussing altruism and ethics with others. Is this a conscious effort or just your personality? Do you have any advice on what attitudes make our ideas persuasive and community attractive to others?**

Why thank you! This comes mainly from personality but involves some conscious effort, and these two components feed on each other over time.

Almost always I mean what I say. I honestly love the fact that people are interested in debating important ideas, even if I don't agree with those ideas. At the very least, people deserve props for saying whatever they think, so that the rest of us can learn more about their psychology. So when I reply "Interesting point, Rob" or "Bill, thanks so much for the comments," I'm being genuine, and this response comes naturally.

What's more, I find that being friendly actually helps me to be less biased. When someone posts an argument with which I disagree, there can be an immediate reaction against it and a desire to find fault. But when take a step back and think about what the argument gets right, I often see at least a sliver of merit to it, and so when I reply to say where and how much I agree with my interlocutor, this not only makes the conversation more positive, but it makes it much easier for me to change my own mind about the issue.

Finally, yes, I do find that being polite is often the best way to "win friends and influence people." I highly recommend Dale Carnegie's classic book from which that phrase is taken. It's interesting that some of the principles of friendship that Carnegie elaborates are similar to principles of rationality as expressed in places like LessWrong. For example, Carnegie's advice to "Let the other person save face" is not unlike Eliezer's "[Leave a Line of Retreat.](http://lesswrong.com/lw/o4/leave_a_line_of_retreat/)" Both recognize that people need to feel emotional safety before they can consider changing their minds. There are some other nice books on the psychology of social change besides Carnegie's, including [Change of Heart](http://humaneconnectionblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/psychology-of-social-change-nick.html) by Nick Cooney.

I think probably it's good when our community doesn't pretend to have all the answers and occasionally admits to being fallible humans rather than perfect saints, although there's no need to dwell on this excessively. I also recommend being thoroughly honest, continuing to seek better answers, focusing on important issues rather than minor details, and having a whole bunch of fun in the process. When we have fun doing good work, it shines through and can be infectious.

**You started a popular website [utilitarian-essays.com](http://utilitarian-essays.com). What is the story behind that, and what impact do you think it has had?**

My 11th-grade English teacher introduced me to formal philosophy and assigned his class to write a short philosophical essay each week. I got into the habit so much that I kept writing philosophical essays after the course ended. Eventually I had a collection of them that I shared with friends, and in 2006, when I first contacted [David Pearce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pearce_(philosopher), he encouraged me to put the essays online. He gave me my website for free and he and his IT guru James Evans continue to host it without charge to this day.

Creating this website was the best thing I've ever done from the perspective of benefit-per-unit-cost. Since 2007, the site has had 120,000 unique visits, including ~23,000 during 2012 alone (or about 120 per day). This is just something I did in my spare time, so I imagine that more focused web development and social marketing could have many times the impact in spreading awareness of issues like [wild-animal suffering](http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-nature.html).

**You currently make your own charity recommendation, to an organisation that promotes veganism and animal liberation. How did you conclude that that was the best option?**

I [recommend](http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/vegan-outreach.html) donating to [Vegan Outreach](http://www.veganoutreach.org/) and/or [The Humane League](http://www.thehumaneleague.com/), especially for people in the US, for whom the donations are tax-deductible. In immediate terms, these organizations prevent a huge amount of suffering for farm animals. For example, The Humane League can use marginal donations to fund advertisements promoting vegetarianism – so called 'veg ads' - which [I conservatively estimate](http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/veg-ads.html ) to prevent ~120 days of suffering on factory farms and 20 additional fish deaths per dollar. The number could plausibly be several times higher. However, I think the much bigger reason to fund veg outreach has to do with wild animals. Suffering in the wild is orders of magnitude greater than all other suffering on Earth.

That said, in addition to promoting ethical sympathy for animals, we also need to make it clear that preserving and spreading natural habitats is not necessarily a good thing for animals, and in fact is [probably net harmful](http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-nature.html), especially when we consider that nearly all animals die painfully within a few days of being born on account of [r-selective reproduction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory). For this reason it will be important to create an organization that popularizes the suffering of animals in the wild specifically, and I plan to switch my donations to this group when it arrives. In the meantime I do think 'veg outreach' is extremely efficient, and it reaches a huge audience of people who may not be ready for "stranger" ideas about our ethical obligations to, say, minnows dying from parasitism.

**What are you planning for the future?**

I'm very excited by the rise of possibly the first animal-welfare metacharity, [Effective Animal Activism](http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org), which assesses the cost-effectiveness of different interventions focused on reducing animal suffering. I helped advise the founders of the organization this past summer, and I'm continuing to support its growth. We've had some promising early successes encouraging more donations to The Humane League and Vegan Outreach and spreading knowledge about the best ways to campaign for vegetarianism. We're currently looking to find a full-time Executive Director for the organization.

Next year I also plan to support another new nonprofit called Animal Ethics. It aims to research and raise awareness about the ways in which animals suffer at the hands of humans but also in nature. The focus on suffering in the wild is what will make Animal Ethics unique compared against all existing animal charities, and we hope to begin shedding more light on this long-neglected topic.

In general, the growth of the effective-altruism movement in the last 1-2 years has taken my breath away. Earlier it had seemed like I was just one of a few close friends on utilitarian forums and email threads making plans for more concrete altruistic organization in the long-term future; now it appears those plans have already begun happening, much faster than I ever expected. The growth of membership in the movement has been explosive, and I can't any longer keep track of all the amazing projects that are going on. Seeing this makes the [haste consideration](http://80000hours.org/blog/43-the-haste-consideration) more viscerally salient. I'm super-excited for what the future of the movement to reduce suffering effectively will look like.

**It has been great talking to you!**

It can be hard to work out what presents people will actually enjoy. An increasingly popular option is to make a donation on behalf of someone else as a present. You might be interested in [Giving What We Can's gift cards that let you donate to the world's most effective charities](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/oxford/cards.php): the deadline for sending them is tomorrow!

When it comes to presents, it seems like a thoughtful gift is better than a gift certificate, and a gift certificate is better than a thoughtless gift. It’s a lot like that for charity gifts too. Your best options are likely to be donations towards [the most effective charities](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/where-to-give/recommended-charities). Next in line are going to be [well-run cash transfer charities.](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly) And in last place will be the unasked-for gift of a goat.

##Why “give a goat”?

What was originally a fairly uninspired set of options for charity gifts has since turned into a wide range of charitable choices for the holidays. Oxfam alone lets you select gifts from [58 different projects](http://www.oxfam.org.uk/shop/christmas/charity-gifts).

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/62/original/christmas_goat.jpg?1355332907'><img align="middle" alt="Christmas goat" class="image medium"  src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/62/medium/christmas_goat.jpg?1355332907" /></a> 

But the old stand-by is sending farm animals to developing countries. This seems unlikely to be motivated by effectiveness. I googled “Give a _____ for christmas” for a bunch of farm animals and wrote down the estimated number of search results.

- Goat: 22,200
- Cow: 1,630
- Chicken: 130
- Pig: 49
- Sheep: 4
- (an) Ox: 0

Now, it’s possible that goats are just much much more valuable to rural people living in developing countries than any other sort of animal. Alternatively, it’s possible that the alliteration of “g” in “Give a goat” makes for catchier headlines. I don’t know for sure, but I have my suspicions.

There are also some decent reasons to think, as [reported by Givewell](http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/23/please-dont-give-me-a-goat-for-the-holidays/), that [donations of livestock might be a particularly ineffective way to help the developing world.](http://www.givewell.org/international/economic-empowerment/livestock-gift-programs) They seem to be quite a lot like cash transfers - where you simply give money to impoverished people - but with a bunch of extra question marks.

With a cash transfer [(which is currently GiveWell’s second recommended charity after AMF)](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly) you empower people to make a decision about what they want most and buy it. That is, cash transfers are like the gift certificate of the charity world.

There are some real concerns about cash transfers. For example they can lead to resentment and arguments when some people receive the transfer and others don’t or have distorting effects on local economies. There are also reasons to think that [some charities beat cash transfers.](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2012-11-30/givewell%E2%80%99s-recommendation-of-givedirectly)

But with animals you lose most of the benefit of cash-transfers - you’re just deciding for people what you think they’ll want. 

You also avoid many of the benefits of the best non-cash transfer charities, [like the ones that Giving What We Can’s holiday cards benefit.](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/oxford/cards.php) Buying someone a goat for Christmas is like getting someone chocolate. You didn’t ask them what they wanted, you don’t really know them too well personally, so you just got the first thing on the shelf that looked like a present. The difference is that chocolate won’t poop on your floor.

It turns out, you can get a thoughtful gift and donate to the most effective charities at the same time! Giving What We Can has it all. [Their website](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/oxford/cards.php) lets you make a donation to one of their top recommended charities - AMF, SCI, or Deworm the World - and sends a charming holiday card to the recipient of your gift. If you order the cards today or tomorrow (by the 13th) you can guarantee that your loved ones will get their present by the 25th.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier></dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2012-12-12 00:00:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status></item><item><title>How many lives does a doctor save? - Part 3 - Replacement</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/101-how-many-lives-does-a-doctor-save-part-3-replacement--84</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[</br>

<center><a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/12/original/doctor.jpg?1345407549'><img alt="Doctor" class="image medium" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/12/medium/doctor.jpg?1345407549" /></a> </center>

</br>


In the [last post](http://80000hours.org/blog/81-how-many-lives-does-a-doctor-save-part-2-diminishing-marginal-returns) we showed that by becoming a doctor, assuming doctors are equally skilled, I would save 600-920 QALYs, with my best guess at 760 QALYs. That’s roughly equivalent to saving 25 lives.

But even this is too generous. If I become a doctor, I won’t increase the total number of doctors by one. The NHS has a limited budget, so it can’t just hire every qualified person who applies; medical schools have limited places by law, and there are more applicants who are ‘good enough’ than there are places. If I become a doctor, then I’ve just displaced *someone else* who would have taken the job.

If we also assume that doctors are equally skilled, then by becoming a doctor you’d have zero impact. You’d simply displace someone equally good. Fortunately, it’s not as bad as this. First, doctors are clearly not equally skilled (as we’ll look at later). But more importantly, by becoming a doctor, you *do*, in one sense, increase the number of doctors.

###Supply-Demand Effect###

If I become willing to work as a doctor, then I increase the *supply* of doctors. If more people are willing to be doctors, then the NHS can slightly decrease the wages for doctors (1).  If the wages are slightly lower, the budget can be used to hire slightly more doctors.

How this all balances out is studied by economists. If the labour market for doctors is in equilibrium, then increasing the supply of doctors by one doctor, will probably increase the number of doctors by about 0.6 (2). In other words, if 10 new qualified people become willing to be doctors, then we’d expect 6 new positions to be created, and only 4 people who would have been doctors to fail to get a job (or a place at medical school). This means the impact of becoming a doctor is only 60% of our current estimate, i.e. about 450 QALYs.

###Skill Level Effect###

Finally, we have to correct this figure for the fact the doctors are not equally skilled. By becoming a doctor, you’ll change the average skill level, and this effect adjusts our impact upwards. When several people attempt to become doctors, the NHS attempts to select the best ones. This means that if you become a doctor, the 0.4 doctors you’d expect to displace from the pool should be less skillful. So, you’ll increase the average skill level. In the next section, I’ll try to put an estimate on this factor. It’s a little technical, so skip ahead to the summary if you don’t want the details.

In an ideal world, as someone enters medicine the NHS would replace the worst doctors in the pool. So, by becoming a doctor, your effect on the pool would be to remove the worst 0.4 of a doctor and replace them with yourself. The worst doctor is likely to have [zero output](http://80000hours.org/blog/69-how-good-are-the-best). So, now let’s assume I’m an average doctor. If we add 10 doctors like myself, and lose 4 with zero output, then we’ve *effectively* gained 10 doctors of average output. So, we have to add another 4 doctors to our earlier estimate of 6. So then the supply-demand correction factor is cancelled out, and you have 100% of the impact of a marginal doctor.

This could easily be an underestimate. The worst doctor is likely to have [negative impact](http://80000hours.org/blog/69-how-good-are-the-best). That’s not because they’re likely to directly do more harm than good, but because they might hamper the effectiveness of lots of team mates. In fact, if there are about 200,000 doctors, there’s reason to expect the worst to roughly counteract the good done by an average doctor i.e. to have an output of ‘-1’ marginal doctors (3). That would mean the by becoming an average doctor I’d displace harmful doctors, doing *more* good than our previous estimate. In fact in this case, the skill level effect would add another 0.8 doctors worth of impact (3).

Unfortunately, the idea that I’ll knock out the worst doctor is a large idealisation. In reality, selection processes are not perfect. Moreover, there’s not always mechanisms to select across the entire NHS, and there’s limits on who can be made redundant. So, it’s very unlikely I’ll knock out the worst doctor, which means the correction we’ve just worked out is an upper bound.

It’s difficult to see how to estimate the efficiency of the NHS’s selection procedures. But let’s suppose, to get a rough idea, that instead of knocking out the worst doctor, I knock out doctors in the bottom decile. If you’re an average doctor, then [your output is probably more than 80%](http://80000hours.org/admin/posts/69-how-good-are-the-best) higher than the bottom decile. Then the correction factor is about 0.2 additional doctors worth of impact (5). This is a very rough estimate, but it’s bounded between 0 and 0.8. Zero is the case when the NHS is unable to select according to ability at all.

If you’re a top-decile doctor instead of an average one, then the correction factor would be about 1. (The bounding range would be 0.8 to 1.6)

Also note that I’ve effectively assumed that doctor skill is uncorrelated with the potential of their position to create health benefits: on my model so far, a top decile doctor would have as much excess impact whether a GP, cardiothoracic surgeon, public health doctor or whatever else. Normally, the highest skilled people get put into the positions with the highest potential for impact (at least insofar as the selection process is efficient). It’s not clear this holds to a large extent in medicine. The most effective activities of the NHS are often unsexy areas like providing vaccines or management. The most skilled doctors might be placed in the most difficult areas, rather than those with the highest effectiveness. Further, many doctors don’t seem to seek to maximise their impact in job selection - there isn’t even publicly available information to help doctors do this. So, my assumption could be reasonable. If this is the case, then there could be opportunities for skilled, altruistically motivated doctors to seek out the positions with the most potential for impact.

If there *was* a tendency for the highest ability people to be put into the most effective positions, then it would increase the impact of becoming a doctor, especially for highly skilled doctors, because the impact of their additional skills would be better leveraged. This correction seems likely to be significantly less than a factor of 2. (6)

###Summary - how much good do doctors really do?###

* We started with an upper bound for the average direct impact of **2600 QALYs**

* The impact of marginal doctors is only a third of the average direct impact, meaning the difference a doctor makes is around **760 QALYs**, with a 95% confidence interval of 600-920 QALYs.

* Supply-Demand Effect: The number of doctors only increases by 0.6, not 1

* Skill-level adjustment: You’re more skilled than your replacements: If you’re of average skill,  the number of doctors effectively increases by an extra 0.2, or in total 0.8, so your marginal impact is **600** QALYs. That’s roughly saving
20 lives.

* The skill-level adjustment is very rough. But it’s likely to be in the range of an extra 0 to 0.8, depending on how effectively the NHS selects doctors according to skill. So, if you’re an average doctor, crudely putting our two ranges together, your impact is in the range of 360 to 1300 QALYs, with a best guess of 600.

* Skill-level adjustment if you’re in the top decile of doctors: The number of doctors *effectively* increases by an extra 1.0, or 1.6 in total, so your impact is **1050 QALYs**. The full range would be from 840 to 2000 QALYs.

* We’ve assumed doctor skill is uncorrelated to the potential of their position to have impact.



###Conclusion###

So we’ve now got a much better estimate of how big a difference I will make working as a doctor: around **600 QALYs**, or around 20 lives - one every two-and-a-bit years or so of my career. Giving 10% of my salary to effective causes that fight global poverty will add around **18 800 QALYs**, a health impact about 30 times higher than what I do directly in my work.

I think my 17-year-old self would find that pretty galling. He’d signed up to medicine to save loads of lives, and he’d find it a bit of a downer to see this his entire medical career would likely do as much good as a £10 000 donation to the right charity. But that would be the wrong way of looking at things: instead, he should see that saving 17 lives is a *vast* amount of good, and being able to do 30 times more good *on top of that* is **awesome**.

It should also brighten up everyone else’s day too. One does not have to be a doctor or an aid worker or any other ‘archetypally moral’ career to make a vast difference; it is within reach of most people in the developed world. So let’s do it.

*Note and References*

(1) It might be easier to see the other way round. Imagine that tomorrow lots of doctors decided they didn’t want to be doctors anymore. In response, the NHS would increase wages and try to tempt them back.

(2) Medicine is highly skilled, so I use a theoretical elasticity of labour demand of -0.5. I assume the elasticity of labour supply is about 0.75, which is an average figure for all jobs taken from this meta-study:

Evers, M., & R. de Mooji, D. v. (2005). What Explains the Variation in Estimates of Labour Supply Elasticities? CESIFO Working Paper No. 1633.

This analysis only applies to the extent that the market for doctors can reach equilibrium. It’s not likely to be in equilibrium due to distorting factors like regulated wages and medical education caps, but it’s not obvious how this affects the figure. If someone has better estimates of labour elasticities for doctors, I would be very interested in seeing them.

(3)  Assume that the ability of doctors is a random variable, X, that’s normally distributed. The population of doctors is a sample of size ‘n’ from X. If n > 10,000, then the expected minimum and maximum value of the sample can be given, to a very high degree of approximation by:

<p> Expected max = b+0.5772*a stdev from mean </p>

<p> Expected min = -(b+0.5772*a) stdev from mean </p>

Where:

<p> a = (2*log(n))^(-0.5) </p>

<p> b = (2*log(n))^0.5-0.5*(2*log(n))^(-0.5)*(log(log(n))+log(4*pi)) </p>

So, for a population of 200,000 doctors, the expected value of the minimum would be 4.5 standard deviations from the mean. The standard deviation is at least 45% of the mean (Ben’s blog post), so the expected value of the minimum is 100 - 4.5 * 45 = -102.5% of the mean

(4) If the worst doctors roughly counteract the benefit of an average doctor, then we can treat them as having impact of -1 doctors. So, if we add 10 doctors of average skill, and lose 4 doctors of -1 skill, then we’ve *effectively* gained 14 doctors of average skill. This means applying a correction of 8 doctors to the original 6 doctors figure.

(5) We add 10 doctors of average skill, and lose 4 of 55% skill, so we effectively gain about 8 doctors of average skill. This means we need a correction factor of 2 doctors.

(6) We've also ignored the tendency to pay worse doctors less. In a perfectly efficient market, you would be paid exactly in proportion to your ability to produce value. So if you were replaced by less skillful doctors, they would be able to pay for more of them to make up for the gap. In practice, this is a long way from the truth. Doctors salaries vary much less than their differences in output, and moreover, are highly regulated.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>e</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2012-09-30 14:55:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>674</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Gregory Lewis</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>gjlewis37@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/gregory-lewis</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-11-01 00:13:33</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Setting the cost at 10 mil per 'life saved' looks to be much more than the NHS is willing to pay, as (upperbounds) 70 years x 30k per QALY ~ 3 million dollars.

* We identified an area that might be promising (which we'll be looking into more): Open Source Appropriate Technology – providing free information about technology that anyone can build that solves problems in the developing world
* We discussed some of the barriers to doing this research: there’s very little funding and a shortage of grad students willing to work in an area with uncertain job prospects
* We discussed the barriers to doing high impact research within academia in general: there’s very little funding, there’s many non-research demands on your time, there’s a need to work on conventional questions to further your career
* We talked about some strategies for dealing with these barriers: sources of funding, how you can do un-funded work alongside your other projects, gaining status (and tenure) in a mainstream field then using it to promote other work, finding a mentor who’s already been there

**Tell us a little about what you do and why you're interested in 80,000 Hours?**

I am a professor at Michigan Tech where I run our Open Sustainability Technology Research Group. My research focuses on open and applied sustainability, which is the application of science and innovation to ensure a better quality of life for all, now and into the future, in a just and equitable manner, whilst living within the limits of supporting ecosystems. Specifically I am interested in exploring the way solar energy can be used to provide clean sustainable electricity through photovoltaic devices and how the sharing of open source hardware and software can create sustainable and equitable means of production (e.g. create open source appropriate technology and other free and open source hardware). This research couples very nicely to the goals of 80,000 Hours.

**Why do you think the research you're working on has the potential to have a big impact? How will progress on this question translate into people's lives getting better?**

My research time is essentially shared between technical aspects of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology, that converts sunlight directly into electricity and open source appropriate technology (OSAT) for sustainable development.
	
For PV I fundamentally work on driving up efficiency – but the entire goal is to make a low-cost solar energy technology that can provide clean sustainable and abundant electricity for everyone. As the solar industry grows it also helps my research scale to have a large impact (e.g. if I develop a means of increasing efficiency only a fraction of a percent and if all the manufacturers use it, millions more dollars in solar energy is generated and we speed the phase out fossil fuels and their concomitant filth). Any improvement to the technical aspects of PV, drives down the cost of solar electricity, which can help on the energy policy front as well. Moving to a solar energy-based society would have a huge impact as it will solve a lot of other problems (e.g. climate change, water pollution, energy wars, etc.).

**But perhaps more exciting is your work on OSAT, tell us a bit more about that.**
	
OSAT refers to technologies that provide for sustainable development while being designed in the same fashion as free and open-source software. OSAT can be anything from a treadle pump to a PV-powered house as long as it is designed with special consideration to the environmental, ethical, cultural, social, political, and economical aspects of the community.  The open-source development model is enormously powerful and if my work helps result in a critical mass of researchers focusing on AT, much of the so-called sustainable development problems will be solved quickly by relentless innovation and collaboration provided by the OS model.

As one example, we could get all the undergrad engineers working on real optimization problems for pieces of technology in the developing world – like doing the fluid mechanics of a new treadle pump – instead of toy problems, which they could find through this OS community.

**Of the areas you're familiar with, which important research question do you think is most funding constrained? If you had $1m of unconstrained money, what would you do with it?**

How to help the globally impoverished (people with no money and no chance at buying conventional 'products') help themselves out of poverty into rich sustainable lives. If I had a $1m of unconstrained research funding I would focus full time on these rarely-funded problems.

**Tell us a little more about why you think this area is particularly promising.**

The greatest chance for real leverage now involves catalyzing more people to contribute to the greater collective good by participating in open-source development of solutions to sustainability problems. This can be through:

* hardcore engineering or science – for example my favorite PV: A. J. Buitenhuis and J. M. Pearce, “Open-Source Development of Solar Photovoltaic Technology”, *Energy for Sustainable Development*, 16, pp. 379-388 (2012). [open access](http://mtu.academia.edu/JoshuaPearce/Papers/1886844/Open-Source_Development_of_Solar_Photovoltaic_Technology) 

* open source science and open access education – J. M. Pearce, *“Building Research Equipment with Free, Open-Source Hardware.”* Science 337 (6100): 1303–1304 (2012) . [open access](http://mtu.academia.edu/JoshuaPearce/Papers/1935580/Building_Research_Equipment_with_Free_Open-Source_Hardware)  Podcast

* or OSAT – J. M. Pearce, “The Case for Open Source Appropriate Technology”, *Environment, Development and Sustainability*, 14, pp. 425-431 (2012). [open access](http://www.academia.edu/1517361/The_Case_for_Open_Source_Appropriate_Technology) 

The hope is that we can get a critical mass of researchers working in this way, so the OS community really takes off.

Appropriate Technology seems particularly exciting. AT involves simple innovations that anyone can implement. This means that there’s zero commercial incentive to work on it, so the area is completely funding-constrained. Nevertheless, many of these innovations have the potential to substantially boost quality of life.

**It sounds a bit like how in medicine there’s little incentive to work on simple solutions to simple questions, like ‘when should I exercise during the day to get a good night’s sleep?’ That’s because there’s no product at the end of it. Nevertheless, if we could find a free, simple way to get more sleep, it would be really useful.**

Exactly. I can get multimillion dollar grants to work on PV energy, but I can’t get 500 bucks to work on a solar water purifier that anyone could build.

**Which important research question do you think is most talent-constrained? In other words, if you could get a smart, dedicated grad student to research an unconstrained topic, what would it be?**

We need technically proficient graduate students that think broadly about the world like social scientists. We need hackers/makers that can and want to work on OSAT – solving technical problems that matter – just not making money, solving puzzles or playing games. Specifically graduate students are needed to work on solar powered self-replicating open-source 3-D printers - capable of making OSAT from recycled waste along with anything else people need. This is a big multi-year massively collaborative project – but it could change everything from the way we construct buildings to how global trade operates. See: 
J. M Pearce, C. Morris Blair, K. J. Laciak, R. Andrews, A. Nosrat and I. Zelenika-Zovko, “3-D Printing of Open Source Appropriate Technologies for Self-Directed Sustainable Development”, *Journal of Sustainable Development * 3(4), pp. 17-29 (2010). [open access](http://www.academia.edu/1507915/3-D_Printing_of_Open_Source_Appropriate_Technologies_for_Self-Directed_Sustainable_Development) 

**Why don’t more grad students work on these problems?**

It’s a more risky option for them. They care about being employable, so they tend to work in fields with commercial relevance.

**But since this area is so neglected, it seems like a bright ‘hacker’ grad student could make a big splash. Jobs often follow from success.**

That might be right!


**What obstacles have you faced to doing important research? In your experience, why does really important research not get done?**

The primary obstacles are funding and wasted time. In my opinion much state- and corporate-sponsored research funding does not directly help solve our sustainability problems, but actively causes additional harm. It is extremely hard to get grants that directly benefit the impoverished, directly help the environment rather than study it, or anything that could hurt profit generation.  So for example, it is much easier to get a grant to study cancer or how to “cure” it than it is to get a grant to quantify Exxon-Mobil's responsibility for additional cancer patients/year. Similarly you can get funding to look at nuclear materials, but are unlikely to win a grant to quantify the nuclear insurance subsidy, which makes it possible for the nuclear industry to exist. You can get funds to make a solar-powered military tent, but not a solar-powered water purification system for villages....you get the idea.
Time is the second biggest constraint. There is a lot of work to do. Bureaucratic overhead burns time and keeps otherwise useful people from doing meaningful work.

**What tips do you have on overcoming these obstacles?**

For funding, I look for the white-knight corporations – the good guys that are trying to do right by people and the planet while running a business. There are tons of examples in the renewable energy field and open source business communities. Leverage these funds to get state funding. 

Work on the most important questions that may not be fundable for free in your own time or link them on funded projects. For example, everyone in my lab must take on a secondary project to work on when they have down time (e.g. when waiting for deliveries). These are invariably unfunded projects. The largest costs for research are 1) overhead and 2) labor. When you do unfunded research 1 disappears and 2 you provide, so you can actually do a lot of good with a little.

For time – don't waste it and try to make it as hard as possible for other people to waste yours. For example, take journal papers or your laptop to read while at mandatory meetings. Block off large sections of the day to think and do research – don't check your email or answer your phone at that time. When you are on the phone stand up. Lose your cell phone. Force petty bureaucrats to invest more time in you than they can extract from you. Surround yourself with people that get things done. Help them succeed and they will return the favor.

**What advice would you offer a grad student who wants to make the world a better place with their research?**

Find a solid mentor/ advisor. This is the most important task you must achieve to be successful in both grad school in general, but also for attacking bigger problems. The ideal advisors are doing the high-impact good-for-the-world research and are generous with their students. Second best is a top pedigree that can teach you how to win – then you can apply the techniques yourself to more important problems later.  When you are interviewing take your prospective mentor's existing graduate students to lunch to see what life is really like in their group. Understand that you will need to work far more than 40 hours a week to be internationally competitive as a graduate student. So make sure you enjoy and are gratified by the subject you are tackling.

For preparing for grad school. Be superior – that means pulling higher grades, working harder and longer than your peers, studying for the GREs, not wasting time getting drunk, etc. Start research early as an undergrad or do experiments on your own. When you apply to graduate school come with a portfolio of work you have done – e.g. engineers better have built something that is impressive – the competition is fierce for any spot worth having. Like most profs. I get dozens of emails a week asking for grad student spots – if you want me to read past the first line of your email it has to be clear that you are elite and want to work with me, not just get paid to go to grad school because you got As. 

In my experience, if you want to do 'good' research you will have to work twice as hard. Make sure you are doing everything to get your degree and become respected in your field AND do your good research. Publish in both the traditional subject literature and your extra subject aggressively. Target the highest impact factor journals possible for your work so it gains visibility. If you like research, I highly recommend you consider becoming a faculty member, because it is one of the few jobs that allows you flexibility with how you spend your time. It is a true blessing. 

**So, you’re suggesting that often it’s best to do well in some conventional area, and then use the position to promote the research you think really matters? Give us some more tips on that.**

To get a tenured faculty spot means you must be able to publish, pull in grant funding, and teach. You should practice all three (e.g. ask to take on a lecture for your advisor and help prepare grants while in grad school). To publish a lot, you need to collaborate. Be kind, look for synergies and be generous with others in your field, help their research succeed and it will pay off in the long term. In many fields you must not only publish, but also get cited to drive up your h-index. The best way to get cited is to do research that is helpful to other researchers solve important problems and make sure they can read it. 80,000 Hours can help you find problems, but be warned that high citation rates are challenging in low-funded research areas. Double up.  To ensure everyone can read your work you must make sure that all of your publications should in some way be open access – even if it is just publishing pre-prints in repositories (institutional, arXiv, SSRN, academia.edu, etc.). If you want your work to be read and used in the developing world this is particularly important. 

In my group we not only open access our articles, but also open-source all of our literature reviews, methodologies, software and now even our equipment schematics and digital designs. We use http://www.appropedia.org to house most of it, which is the largest open-edit wiki dedicated to sustainability and poverty reduction. I have found this open-source research method extremely successful.  The results of this experimental “aggressive sharing” found that more rapid deployment of sustainability technologies is possible with i) massive peer-review in the development of background material and experimental design, ii) increased visibility, which leads to iii) increased funding opportunities and improved student recruitment, and iv) improved student research-related training and education.

Over the last few years, we’ve seen an explosion of interest in the topic. More and more of us are finding each other to ask not only “How can I help?” but “How can I help better?”

There’s a new organization asking these questions: [The High Impact NetworK](http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/), THINK’s goal is to introduce people to ideas and skills that will help them do good more effectively.

This fall, THINK meetups will be starting at universities and in cities around the world. THINK is developing a curriculum of presentations and activities that can be picked up and used by anyone who wants to lead such a group. The modules cover areas of interest to effective altruists: charity assessment, paths to impact, making science better and more. (You can take a look at the [sample modules](http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/modules) currently on the website.) The modules are designed to teach newcomers about the basics of effective altruism, but also to offer self-improvement tools that can help participants reach their chosen goals.

Of course, 80,000 Hours and THINK share many of the same goals. In the coming months, THINK meetups will provide venues for speakers and written material from 80,000 Hours. Its modules will refer interested people to 80,000 Hours for more information on high-impact careers.

The key difference between the organisations is that THINK focuses on helping people all over the world to set up group meet-ups, while 80,000 Hours focuses on online content, careers advice via Skype and events in Oxford, Princeton and Yale.

As THINK gears up to launch 20 to 30 groups this fall, I remember how it felt to realize I wasn’t alone. I remember the excitement of meeting other people who not only wanted to change the world, but were trying to do it in a way that might actually accomplish something. I heard ideas I thought were nuts and ideas I wished I had thought of. I met people I could debate with, collaborate with, think things through with.

This fall, a new wave of people will get the chance to have those life-changing encounters.

Want to be part of this? Find out if there’s a meetup [starting near you](http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/meetups) this fall. If not, THINK’s [website](http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/) offers the tools you need to start one. Or [email a real person] at THINK.

There are [regular] (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120607092616.htm) [news]( http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/mar/28/face-transplant-man-richard-norris) [stories] (http://www.nature.com/news/rabbits-kept-alive-by-oxygen-injections-1.10899) about how advances in medical science promise to help more people than ever before. Many of us have had the experience of being ill, seeing our doctor, and being made better.

So it seemed a pretty good career move for a 17-year old wanting to make a difference. Like thousands of others, I applied to read medicine. This is what I wrote on my personal statement:

> I want to study medicine because of a desire I have to help others, and so the chance of spending a  career doing something worthwhile I can’t resist. Of course, Doctors don’t have a monopoly on altruism, but I believe the attributes I have lend themselves best to medicine, as opposed to all the other work I could do instead.

Was I right? Is medicine a good career choice for someone wanting to 'make a difference'?

Over the next few posts we are going to try and answer this question, and try to estimate the impact one can expect to make becoming a doctor in the UK (which will be pretty similar to the impact made anywhere else in the developed world). This post will look at the average direct impact of a doctor. To estimate this, we’ll look at the total impact of medicine and then divide it by the number of doctors. The second post will try and account for the fact that by becoming a doctor, I’ll only cause there to be *additional* doctors. Since the first doctor will add far more to health than the hundredth, *my* impact will be less than the average direct impact. The third post will account for replaceability: that if I never went to medical school, someone else would have taken my place. To wrap up, the final post will discuss how a budding doctor can make the biggest difference they can.

### How much good does medicine do?

Life expectancy in the UK was around [47 in 1900](http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/rp99/rp99-111.pdf#page=9); it [is now 80]( http://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&idim=country:GBR&dl=en&hl=en&q=uk+life+expectancy ).  To what degree can medicine take credit for this vast improvement?

By the lights of most experts, not very much. During the last century the population in the developed world became better fed, wealthier, better educated, and living in safer and more hygienic environments, and these take the lion's share of responsibility for our longer lives. Consider this graph from [Mckinlay and Mckinlay]( http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/pubhealth/rosner/g8965/client_edit/readings/week_2/mckinlay.pdf) of the medical effects on US mortality. Note how total mortality falls dramatically despite the small proportion of GDP spent on health, and that dramatic increases in health spending do not accelerate this downward trend:

* * *

Despite this, it is likely medicine has *some* effect: data from the [Netherlands]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez/3227384?dopt=Abstract&holding=f1000,f1000m,isrctn) show that there are 'bumps' in life-expectancy of those with a given disease that coincide with the advent of improvements in that diseases treatment. We really want to know is how big that effect generally is: is medicine 40% responsible for our better health? 4%? 0.04%?

One approach from [Bunker](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/6/1260.long) is to compile an 'inventory' of medical care (including both prevention and cure) for the commonest diseases: look at medical trials to see what life expectancy effects a given treatment has, extrapolate these effects to the wider population with the disease, and then add them all up. Bunker gives the following estimates:

+ Medical care can be credited with 5 to 5.5 years of the increase in life expectancy since 1900...
+ … But Iatrogenic (medicine-caused) disease reduces life expectancy by 0.5 to 1 year.
+ Medicine also improves wellbeing: the average person has five more years free of disability.

Bunker’s method is likely to overestimate the impact of medicine. The impact of a treatment in a clinical trial is known to be [much higher than its effect in everyday clinical practice]( http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/6/1263.full). However, it is the only quantified estimate available, so let's use it to try and work out how much good an individual doctor does.

* * *

### How much good does a doctor do? A Fermi calculation

We do not know what it would be like to 'subtract away' all medical care from a population, but the 1900 population is not a bad surrogate: at this time, medicine was barely funded, unavailable to many and primitive. So 'amount of good done by medicine between 1900 until now' approximates 'amount of good done by medicine'.

We’ll assume the benefits of medicine primarily consist of benefits to our health, though of course there might be others. We’ll also assume that we’re talking about doctors practicing medicine (providing care); medical research is a potentially high impact avenue beyond the remit of the current discussion.

We can use Bunker's estimates to perform a 'back of the envelope' calculation of how much impact on health an average doctor has. To do this we'll be using the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) as our metric:  one QALY is one year of healthy life (1). According to Bunker, the average person gains about 5.25 years due to medicine, but loses 0.75 years due to medicine-caused disease. That makes for a net gain of 4.5 QALYs. But we also need to consider how much healthy life is added by treating disability. This is trickier, but a generous estimate is to equate the ‘5 free years of disability’ to 2.5 QALYs (2).

Totting those up means the total gain per person is seven QALYs. On average, each of us has seven more years of healthy life (either in length or in quality) thanks to our doctors.

Now let’s look at things on a population level. Multiplying up by the 62.6 million population of the UK means medicine adds 438.4 million years of healthy life to the UK.  We know there are around [2.7 doctors per 1 000 population] (http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.PHYS.ZS) in the UK, making around 172 000 total. So the ‘share’ per doctor is:

438 487 000 / 171 824 = **2552 QALYs**

* * *

###Taking stock

This doesn't look too bad: intuitively you could think of it as saving about 90 lives. But it turns out this figure is an upper bound.

1. We’ve used generous estimates for the amount of good done by medicine - most experts think it should be less than this.
2. We've ignored the fact that the increase in life expectancy in old age is probably [associated with increased disability](http://www.ageing.ox.ac.uk/files/workingpaper_206.pdf#page=17), and so the 4.5 years of increased life expectancy should not be counted at 'full value'.
3. Doctors cannot take sole credit for the impact of medicine: what about nurses, scientists, cleaners, managers?

More importantly, the figure we’ve worked out does not tell us how much difference I might expect to make by *becoming* a doctor. What we need to work out is the additional good done by an extra person becoming a doctor that wouldn’t have happened otherwise.

This means taking into account two extra effects:

1. **Diminishing marginal returns** – some tasks performed by doctors have more impact than others. If there were one fewer doctor, the highest impact tasks they perform would be given to someone else, so the total impact wouldn’t reduce proportionally with the number of doctors.

2. **Replaceability** – if I don’t become a doctor, someone else will. So again, the difference *I* make is reduced.

We’ll discuss these effects in future posts, but they will mean that the impact of me becoming a doctor is much less than our estimate. Yet in any case, I can [do much more good](http://80000hours.org/why-become-a-professional-philanthropist?) by [giving wisely](http://www.givewell.org/giving101). If I donate 10% of my salary to AMF, I’ll protect about 20,000 people from malaria, saving about 6 times as many QALYs, and causing many other economic and education benefits (3). I can do far more good with my chequebook then I can expect to accomplish with my stethoscope.

*References and Notes*

(1) For more on QALYs and measuring healthcare, see [here]( http://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/features/measuringeffectivenessandcosteffectivenesstheqaly.jsp).

(2) Bunker only talks about 'years made free of disability', but how valuable this is depends on how bad the disabilities are: five years free of dementia is worth much more than five years free of knee pain, for example. The WHO [has a table]( http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GBD2004_DisabilityWeights.pdf) of how much given disabilities should ‘weigh’: a weight of 0.2 means five years free of this disability is worth about as much as one extra year of healthy life. As very few conditions (and none of the commonest ones) are weighed higher than 0.5, we can be confident that the ‘five life-years made free of disability’ will equate to no more than half that amount in QALYs.

(3) There are some caveats. AMF will try to spend its funds on the most cost-effective programs first, and (hopefully!) over time the ‘lowest hanging fruit’ of cheap ways of greatly improving people’s welfare will be taken. So money I give later in my life may have [less impact than current day estimates](http://80000hours.org/blog/43-the-haste-consideration) (although similar effects will likely apply to the work doctors do as well). Also, there might be different ‘knock-on’ effects of helping richer people than helping poorer people, and the wealthy might be ‘worth more’ if they can add a lot more wealth which trickles down. Anyway, the working:
Average doctor salary in the UK is [£69 952 a year](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2067258/Best-paid-jobs-2011-Tables-official-figures-UK-salaries.html). Assuming I give 10% of that pre-tax income, and I work for 43 years (qualify at 25, retire at 68), total given over my lifetime will be:
£69 952/year * 43 years * 10% = £300 793.60
AMF’s effectiveness is thought to be around: $25/QALY. That’s around £16. So:
£300 793.60 / £16/QALY = 18 800 QALYs
So around 6 times the (upper bound on) direct benefit of a medical career.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>H</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2012-08-19 20:39:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>486</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Ryan Carey</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>ry.duff@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-08-20 07:01:05</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Three suggestions
1. Doctors do not work for free. Not only do they impose a cost by causing some iatrogenic (medically caused) diseases, as you have suggested, but they also impose a financial cost upon their patients, if they work in the private system, or upon everyone, via taxes, if they work in the public system.
2. This "per-doctor" figure presupposes the support of the entire health system. What would make more sense would be to consider what fraction of health-care spending is on doctors and medicines. If this is 1/10th, then a lower bound for the amount of good done by doctors is 255 QALYs.

In approximate order:

1) I haven't factored in financial costs, in part because I am not sure how. 
2) Future posts will take a better look at the fact that doctors don't singlehandedly do all medical care which you mention, which will drive down the upper bound significantly.
3) Replaceability corrections will depend at what stage you are at, and short-run supply medical labour is pretty inelastic, but it is not clear how it is over the longer term.

Firstly, the article perpetuates the dated notion that the main job of doctors is to 'save lives'. In the first world, saving lives is a diminishing role of a doctor. Many doctors take roles that do not directly 'save lives', but improve the quality of life of patients in addition to serving important social functions.

Take the example of a psychiatrist. Psychiatrists treat illness like depression and schizophrenia which are a main cause of suicide, homicide and loss of productive/ meaningful life. In the UK, there are 140,000 suicides and 6,000 suicide deaths every year. I have been taught that for every two suicides, one is successfully halted by a mental health professional. The author or Bunker fails to take into account these statistics. 

(http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/emotional_health/mental_health/mind_suicide.shtml)

Importantly, many patients with mental illnesses don't kill themselves or others. They basically just lose out with society. Patients with schizophrenia (like John Nash) can be perfectly normal before getting ill, but are rendered non-functional because of the hallucinations and delusions they experience as from their illness. Psychiatrists are able to intervene so that more than two thirds of these patients can return to a relatively normal life. Depressed patients, if untreated, suffer immensely from their poor mood. Just imagine how much 'happiness' psych doctors produced as a result of their counselling, drug and other treatment. Again, the authors dismiss these 'good things' done by doctors on the basis that they do not extend the life expectancy of patients.

Fundamentally, the problem with the author's quantitative approach is that he reduces human existence into 'living' or 'not-living'. He neglects how doctors improve the quality of life of patients. A day spent lying on a bed sucking food from a straw is very different from a day spent learning at school, playing football and going out with friends. The entire article struck me as highly theoretical and out of touch with reality. Life is not a number that you live up to. It is a continuum where you become gradually disabled and dysfunctional by ageing and various diseases. Doctors do a lot of good by halting that progress.

Another example that came to my mind - orthopaedic surgeons. They save very few lives by your standards. Having all your bones and joints broken will not kill you. The only bone disease that can kill you is bone cancer because it can damage other vital organs like your lung and brain. It is very rare anyway. But just think of how much good an orthopaedic surgeon has done just by doing joint replacement surgery of the knee. 15% of the 45+ population experiences knee pain due to degenerative osteoarthritis (OA) and by 65 years old 10% of the population cannot walk because of OA. After surgery these people can walk again, do sport, and basically have an active life. Without such treatment they will be confined at home or to a wheelchair. What a difference. But under your analyses their work isn't of worth because not a life is saved. This is pretty absurd.

Finally, I find the idea of choosing an occupation purely based on how much lives it can save quite disturbing, and I would not give such career advice to anyone. Like it or not, you spend 8+ hours a day working and if the nature of your job bores you, you will be devastated, even if the job yields good returns (ethical, monetary, etc). When you're operating on a patient, you are not thinking of saving lives. You are thinking of how you use your scalpel to cut tissue and stop bleeding by diathermy. That the patient's life is saved as a result of the operation is only a secondary outcome. Just as I imagine the author as a very theoretical and quantitative person who has an intention of doing good to society (saving lives), I don't think he will enjoy talking a woman out of death even if it may save her life. That reminds us that there are many personalities out there and it is important to find a job that fits your own abilities and interests. To conclude I think a medical career offers ample opportunities to do good so if you are intellectually capable and that helping others on a human level is your strength, I would invite you to consider it. ]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1098</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Kelila </wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>kk501@cam.ac.uk</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-06-05 14:32:34</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Agreed!

Neil: 
I'd say something like "The lions share of the battle in health is in the living conditions of people - so much of disease is caused or exacerbated by these things. Having a population that is well fed, access to clean water, sanitation, shelter, education and financial security will fare far better than populations without these things, even if they have similar access to medical care."

Good things to look at are intra-country social gradients of health (wealthier people live longer in the UK than poorer people, people who are homeless in the UK have a life expectancy of around 50, despite - at least in principle - having access to the NHS, etc.) Also there are neat data (which I’ll talk about next!) about how heath corresponds to health spending and number of doctors. Not sure if that helps…

A Medical Student (and Another Medical student)

1) The estimate above does try to look at wellbeing improvements instead of ‘just’ life expectancy. Bunker estimates medicine gives 5 years free of disability, which you can attempt to translate into QALYs (cf. footnote 2)

2) There are ‘second order’ effects of being a doctor in terms of being a community role model, helping out with health policy, and things like that. I’m unsure how to factor these things in: I guess the first thing that springs to mind is that the behaviour of most doctors (barring public health physicians, medical directors, etc) is directed towards clinical activities rather than health policy work, making their good reputation clear, and so on. I could be wrong about this, but I guess if it transpires the main impact (or a big chunk of the impact) of being a doctor is these things rather than their ‘direct’ work, that is pretty interesting.

3) If I may, I’m going to bracket the issue about the replaceability argument, as it will be the subject of an entire post which will (hopefully!) answer your concerns about replaceability.

4) I’m also a bit biased: I’m a member of Giving What We Can, so I’m pretty keen on people giving lots of money, and so I find it interesting to compare how much good earning to give can do compared to one’s entire medical career.

But I certainly don’t think they’re mutually exclusive (I want to do both myself!) And medicine is a pretty good way of both earning lots of money as well as the satisfaction you get from directly helping others. I would say, though, that we should try to give priority to stuff that does lots of good over what makes us feel satisfied we are doing good, and because there are lots of people willing to help directly, there’s still plenty of room for people earning to give.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>502</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>A third medical student</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>martina.p.ravlic@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-08-20 18:04:31</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello! Just discovered this community! Great stuff so far. 

I have some thoughts on the above article. I think you raise some valid points and I would recommend the (provided for free by the authors) book Testing Treatments (http://www.testingtreatments.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/testing-treatments.pdf) that also delves further in to how to be efficient and successful physicians and how to approach treatments and patients in a scientifically verifiable and mutually respectful (doctor/patient relations) approach.

However. I think you need to distinguish between different disciplines of medicine as well, would I put an infectious disease specialist working in sub-saharan africa trained at the same school as the plastic surgeon with a huge clinic down the road under the same category?

I think not. As the other med-students on here I'm obviously biased, but deciding on medicine was a three-year hitching-around-the-world process for me in deciding how to best be able to bring something to a community other than your own uneducated labor (the last thing many regions in the world needs more of), and how medicine not only lets you interact with people and help them in immediately tangible ways, but gives you a certain level of respect (can be abused, to be sure) that can help you influence other areas of a community. "Men should let their families sleep with them under the mosquito nets provided by NGO's" and similar commentary.


Where you go on to practice medicine, as well as what kind will have tangible effects, as I'm sure you will agree on, and then, who is to say that you need to limit yourself to medical practice exclusively? Look at someone like Hans Rosling, who works with international policy changes (most effective in helping to alleviate large scale inequality), whilst working from a unique perspective of having dressed wounds and infections of the very people he wants to go on to help, with their wants, needs and expectations clear to him.


The important thing is to not let yourself be limited as well, I might go on to practice medicine, but that doesn't mean that I don't take immense interest in the financial and social policies that go on around me, and try to do my part in directing them in more sustainable directions.

I hadn't encountered this research on the proportion of life expectancy gains which come from medicine before and find it interesting. It makes sense that a lot of the gains are from living conditions, nutrition, and public health. 7 QALYs per person is actually a lot, and is an intuitively reasonable estimate. Most people in the UK would value this at above £140,000 worth of value, so I don't think doctors (or aspiring doctors) need treat this estimate as putting a low value on their services.

One issue I noticed is that the health gain data is for 1900 to about 2000, and if it is based on mortality data, that is for people dying by 2000. However, if you are an 18 year old considering medicine in 2012, you will retire in 2062. So some of the people you treat will be in 2062, some of whom will die in 2140 or later. Life expectancy is expected to rise quite a lot more, so this matters. It might be worth looking into some estimates on this, or even just eyeballing it on the chart. Intuitively, it seems that this kind of thing could make the impact from medicine as much as twice as good as your numbers (since what we want is the impact from medicine during the time of your career). Note that even if medicine doesn't improve, but other things increase lifespan, this still makes medicine higher value as saving the life of a twenty-year-old will then save 100 years of life instead of 60 (or whatever).]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>512</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Benjamin Todd</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>benjamin.john.todd@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/benjamin-todd</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-08-23 13:56:44</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm surprised that so many readers think Greg isn't taking quality of life improvements into account.

I agree with the last comment that making a difference (or, in this case, 'saving lives') is not the *only* thing that matters in choosing a job. But it *does* matter. Sometimes it can be more important than what you'll enjoy.

FOR TOBY

The issue you raise is something I completely missed when thinking about this, so thanks for pointing me in the right direction. :)

I think you are right that life expectancy should continue increasing - and further, it is likely that increasing proportions of that increase will be thanks to medical care. So there might be some reason to think that future impact of a doctor might be higher in the future.

That said, I’m not sure how to factor these things in the face of empirical and normative uncertainity. On the empirical side, although life expectancy is projected to increase, there’s also a retangularization thesis - our ‘natural maximum’ lifespan appears fairly unchanged, so improvements to health push us closer and closer to this limit. Further afield (which I guess is your forte), there are all sorts of future technologies (not to mention any black swans) that could completely change the life expectancy of a child born in the next 50 years or so. So I’m unsure how to better forecast the impact of a doctor starting now: I guess extrapolating the current linear trend is the best bet as you suggest.

Normatively, there’s a big debate about how long should we ‘ideally’ live, and so the underlying assumption used that all QALYs are broadly equal (or even a good thing) might be violated - perhaps three-score and ten is ideal, but getting ourselves to all live to 150 (or 15000) is net negative. (Hedonic Treader makes a related point in how QALYs may diverge from common morality - fertility services might be QALY negative). Population ethics starts to loom large here.

I might try (when I get time!) to write some more on likely future importance of medical care.


FOR MEDICAL STUDENT THE THIRD

One of pleasant problems of trying to investigate something like this is you end up finding lots of avenues to investigate further. I agree we should look at medical sub specialities, as they end up doing very different things: the ID doc in africa probably does more good than the archetypal cosmetic surgeon, but the latter will earn a lot more money, and giving it wisely could fund quite a few more ID docs, etc. etc. Rohling exemplifies yet another way doctors can do good through public advocacy and education. 

For now I am focusing on the 'direct' good doctors do - via bandages, drugs, and all the stereotypes of clinical practice. I hope to address the wider question of what doctors should try to do to maximize the good they accomplish later. If you want to help me out, please do get in touch!


FOR JILL

I've looked at the RAND experiments, (and Hanson's work), I'm unsure how well it extrapolates out of the US system. The main thing I will be looking at in the next posts is intra-country comparisons, particularly between developed countries: does lifespan or DALYs/100000 change when you spend a bit more on health (or hire a few more doctors) when you are already a developed country?]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>498</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Another medical student</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>jj888@live.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-08-20 14:05:43</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA["A Medical Student" above makes an excellent point that the doctors' role does not just extend lifespan, but also improve quality of life in disease. Way back when, nutrition and sanitation was poor etc. and acute disease was what killed you. As you say, it is the aforementioned nutrition and sanitation that has contributed vastly to the improved life expectancy. However, without medical intervention, the people would then suffer (even more) years of misery of ischaemic heart disease/ diabetes, unless you argue that they would all die quickly of CVAs, which surely is not a desirable outcome in any case. Therefore, one could argue that medical intervention has a role in both increasing life expectancy AND morbidity, on a background of improved "conditions of life".

I also can't agree with the replaceability argument- that if you didn't become a doctor, someone would in your place. Assuming you decided your time was better spent elsewhere, someone considered "inferior" to you in your initial application would have taken your place, and would, assuming an ideal selection process, yield a less competent doctor, giving a net decrease in quality of healthcare in the NHS (no matter how small). The next issue would be what you would do yourself instead, for you would have to displace someone else of their occupation, be it investment banker/lawyer/ whatever would earn you more money to give away. You may be earning the money, someone else isn't, so unless that person you have just displaced was never going to donate, you have actually made no real diference to the money donated, decreased the quality of doctors in the NHS AND deprived someone of a high-paying job. In theory.

I get the overall vibe that you are trying argue that donating is a *better* option than being a doctor. I don't see why this comparison is necessary, as if the two were mutually exclusive. Sure, you can donate £X and assume you've fed X no. of kids for a year in Rwanda, but that satisfaction cannot be compared with saving just one young lad presenting to you in ED with DKA!

Meanwhile, you can donate all you like, but someone must USE the money that you donate. And a significant (if minority) of this will be spent by doctors!]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>750</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Ben</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>naloxone13@yahoo.co.uk</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-12-03 19:47:10</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Fascinating stuff. Could I suggest reading the brilliant "The Dressing Station" by Jonathan Kaplan. It completely changed my views on my career by highlighting the many ways in which doctoring is undertaken. Not all of them good. There is one point where he is working as a surgeon and someone comes to build a well - he realises the impact he has made compared to the engineer over the same time and is utterly humbled, as was I.

But to dismiss medicine as not helping enough people is nonsense. Sure, the impact of another doctor in the NHS is far less than one treating NTDs in Africa in terms of lives saved, but are you really suggesting its some sort of competition? I am lucky enough to work in an acute medical speciality, although this means that in work I am likely to help just a handful of very rich (globally) individuals, most of whom are at (least partly) unwell due to their relative afluence. I say lucky as I get to see the lives I save. It happens in front of me. Truly, I can count those I have saved myself on my fingers alone but nonetheless the impact I have made to those individuals is profound. And if they are earning and contributing themselves (or go on to cure cancer, or make mosquito nets), then I have to factor some of that positivity into the overall effect I have had. I think care needs to be taken when declaring that I can "do more good with my cheque book". It needs some context.

Does that make me complacent and arrogant about the impact I can have on a global scale? Not at all (I hope!). I still have that well in my mind every day, and still give what I can (earning nothing like the estimates on this site, I can assure you!) as I know that to the world's poorest, this is the best way to really make a difference.

Did I go into medicine because I thought I could save the world? No. And anyone who does is likely to be disappointed. Do I think my job makes a difference? Of course. Will a well engineer in a third world country save more people than me over my career? Undoubtedly, but if you're unfortunate enough to have a heart attack I know who will be more useful.

So my humble advice to the doubting medical students posting here is: be good doctors; AND contribute to helping the wider world. You'll do good with both.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>How to judge your chances of success</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/132-how-to-judge-your-chances-of-success</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[<br>

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/63/original/success.jpeg?1355674407'><img alt="Success" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/63/large/success.jpeg?1355674407" /></a>

<br>

You want to make a difference. This means being as successful as possible in whatever high-impact path you choose to pursue. In some recent posts I raised a worry that we might overestimate our chances of success, due to a tendency to think of ourselves as [better than average](http://80000hours.org/blog/124-do-you-think-you-re-better-than-average), and to pay too little attention to [information about the average person](http://80000hours.org/blog/124-do-you-think-you-re-better-than-average). This could lead you to pick careers that turn out not to suit.

However, some people have made the point that we also don’t want to go too far the other way and *underestimate* ourselves. Sometimes we do have reason to think we’re better than average at something, and we shouldn’t ignore this. Underestimating our chances of success might stop us from pursuing potentially high impact paths.[^1] *What if you think you really are better than average?* After all, whilst no-one is above average at everything, almost everyone will be above average at *something.*

In this post I’ll talk through some of the best ways we’ve found for working out your chances of success in a career.

**In summary, the process is:

1. **Work out which factors (personality traits, skills and abilities) are most relevant to success in the field you’re considering
2. **Find ways to objectively measure yourself on these factors
3. **Given this information, narrow down your reference class to those similar to you
4. **Get your “base rate” from this class

<br>

##Think about what’s relevant

You might have really solid evidence that you’re slimmer than the average person, but this isn’t going to alter your chances of success in most careers - unless you want to be a supermodel. It might sound obvious, but the best place to start is by thinking about which factors (such as personality traits, skills, abilities) are most relevant to success in the domain you’re considering, and then see how you measure up on those.

Some measures are going to be relevant to pretty much any career: intelligence is arguably one, although it may well be more important in some domains than in others. A [meta-analysis](http://people.tamu.edu/~mbarrick/Pubs/1991_Barrick_Mount.pdf) looking at the relation between the “Big Five” personality dimensions (extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, openness and conscientiousness) and job success in a number of domains suggests that high conscientiousness is a consistent predictor of success across domains. The relationship between the other traits and success varies more across job areas.[^2]

In some jobs the most relevant skills are going to be fairly obvious: being highly numerate is going to increase your chances of success in accounting, for example; being exceptionally good at public speaking will help you with advocacy. Sometimes it might be less clear what the most important considerations are. It might help to speak to someone with experience in the area, or look at typical job descriptions.

##Make sure you’re justified

Say you’re pretty sure you’re above average intelligence. What is your justification for this? Going with a “hunch” isn’t good enough: you need to know what that hunch is based on.

There are some pretty good objective measures of intelligence. IQ tests and your past academic records are two pretty good ways. Try to get some data on how this places you: if you’ve got 2:1 degree from one of the top 10 universities in the country, find out what percentage of people in your age group have the same achievement. Intelligence tests will generally tell you what percentile your result puts you in.[^3] 

Similarly, there are a number of personality tests that measure the Big Five personality traits.[^4] It’s harder to see how objective a measure these tests are. They generally involve stating how much you agree or disagree with a statement about yourself such as “I am good at a lot of things”, and you’re clearly biased. If you do your best to answer honestly, though, these tests should give you a rough idea of where you fall on the relevant personality traits. It might help to try taking a number of different ones.

If you think you’re above average in any respect, try to find some objective measure to justify this. If you can use multiple different ways of doing this and put a number to it, even better.

##Find the appropriate average

I argued previously that the best place to start when judging your chances of success is by looking at the average person. This isn’t strictly true. If you’re a PhD student at Yale trying to work out your chances of becoming a tenured professor, you’re obviously not going to start out comparing yourself to the “average” U.S. citizen, who probably doesn’t have a college degree.[^5] You’re going to compare yourself to the average PhD student at an Ivy league college. 

Looking at the *relevant* “average” is crucial to accurately judging your chances: you need to work out what the appropriate reference class is. 

**Choosing an appropriate reference class**

Sometimes it’s obvious what the appropriate reference class is, other times it’s harder. A general strategy would be to ask yourself the following question: what specific information do I have about myself that is both *reliable* and *relevant* to the outcome I’m trying to predict? 

Suppose Daniel is our doctoral student trying to predict his chances of receiving tenure. What’s the relevant information here? The fact that he is doing a PhD, and that he is doing it at an Ivy League university, are both pretty clearly relevant in the sense that they clearly affect a person’s chances of becoming a tenured professor. (There might be other pieces of relevant information, such as his position within his class, or level of conscientiousness, but let’s keep it simple for now.) Irrelevant information, on the other hand, would be the fact that Daniel has dark hair. There’s no evidence that people with dark hair are more likely to become tenured professors.

What about the reliability of this information? I think Daniel can be pretty sure that the information that he is doing a PhD at Yale is reliable. An unsupported judgement about his position in the class, on the other hand, might not be entirely reliable information, so shouldn’t be taken into account until he has evidence to back up this judgement. 

**Taking the outside view**

This method of basing our predictions on a class of roughly similar cases is what Daniel Kahneman refers to as [“the outside view.”](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Outside_view) In contrast, to take the “inside view” is to focus on the specifics of your own case when making predictions. Due to the fact that we tend to be over-optimistic when considering the specifics of our own case, taking the inside view has the tendency to lead to the [planning fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy) (a tendency to underestimate the amount of time it will take to complete an activity). In particular, people seem to find it hard to fully envision the possible circumstances that could lead to failure in their own case. Taking the outside view is also commonly referred to as [reference class forecasting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_class_forecasting): using information about other cases in the relevant reference class to make forecasts.

Taking the outside view is the best known way to take account of any solid evidence that your chances are better than average, without falling prey to the base rate fallacy. If you want to know your chances of success, best to start with the average person’s chances of success: but sometimes you might have good reason to make certain assumptions about what this “average person” looks like.

However, sometimes you might have information suggesting you differ from average that’s strong enough to warrant consideration, but not strong enough or of the right nature to justify changing the entire reference class. Suppose Daniel has good reason to believe he is more conscientious than average (he did a number of personality tests, checked his responses with a number of people who knew him well to make sure he wasn’t overly biased in his answers, etc...). If he tried to change the reference class here, it would have to be something like “PhD students at Ivy League universities with the same level of conscientiousness as Daniel” which seems difficult to identify in practice, and is also likely to be too small to be useful. But it doesn’t seem like he should ignore this information either. In these cases, we need a way of updating on baseline predictions given evidence, dependent on the strength and reliability of that evidence. This isn’t easy: I’ll talk about how to do this in an upcoming post.

The work of world-renowned Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, expressed in her popular bestseller Mindset, suggests this is a harmful mindset to have. Her work shows that those with a growth mindset, or belief that any skill, talent, characteristic, etc, can be learned, consistently attain greater success in the long-term, with large effect sizes. Her work resonates with me personally because as a gifted youngster--typically testing 99th percentile throughout grade school, perfect 36 on the math portion of the ACT, etc--who nevertheless failed to stand above my peers in college math and science, I have been able to see that I had quite a strong orientation toward the fixed mindset.

What I am not doing is claiming that the rational approach to thinking of success outlined above, designed to overcome biases, is harmful in toto. What I am claiming is that–common with a lot of other similarly intelligent and rational people, as expressed e.g. on lesswrong.com–the beliefs that constitute the growth mindset are entirely absent, and that that is unfortunate. I recommend ‘Mindset’.

Implicit to this approach is a fixed mindset: that characteristics or abilities are fixed and that they determine success at <something>. The work of world-renowned Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, expressed in her popular bestseller Mindset, suggests this is a harmful mindset to have. Her work shows that those with a growth mindset, or belief that any skill, talent, characteristic, etc, can be learned, consistently attain greater success in the long-term, with large effect sizes. Her work resonates with me personally because as a gifted youngster--typically testing 99th percentile throughout grade school, perfect 36 on the math portion of the ACT, etc--who nevertheless failed to stand above my peers in college math and science, I have been able to see that I had quite a strong orientation toward the fixed mindset.

What I am not doing is claiming that the rational approach to thinking of success outlined above, designed to overcome biases, is harmful in toto. What I am claiming is that--common with a lot of other similarly intelligent and rational people, as expressed e.g. on lesswrong.com--the beliefs that constitute the growth mindset are entirely absent, and that that is unfortunate. I recommend 'Mindset'.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Can you measure the good you’ll do?</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/189-can-you-measure-the-good-you-ll-do</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/154/original/measure.jpg?1369745693'><img alt="Measure" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/154/large/measure.jpg?1369745693" /></a>

The idea that it’s impossible to measure which career lets you make the most difference is silly.

If it were true, then packing meat for a living would be, for all we know, as good for the world as running Oxfam or being a great President.

Why, then, do we so often meet the idea that ‘you can’t measure the good done by a career’? - an idea that quashes debate about what’s best to do, and thus leads millions of ambitious young people to do less for the world than they could.

Here’s the mistakes I think are being made.


**1. Thinking measurement needs to be perfectly precise**

Thinking back to school science classes, it’s easy to think ‘measuring’ means ‘precisely quantifying.’  A classic example is using a pair of scales to weigh something, and having a ‘precise’ number as the result. In choosing between careers, we don’t get precise numbers, so the good you do is not measurable.

But this isn’t a good way to think about measurement. No measurement is perfectly precise. Weighing with scales actually only gives you a range of probable values for the true weight, because the scales are not 100% accurate. In reality, there’s always some uncertainty. Our choice is only ever *how much* uncertainty is OK given our purposes. 

If there’s always some uncertainty left, then we can see that in practice what it is to measure some quantity is to reduce uncertainty about its magnitude. That’s all that’s actually possible. But now that we’ve given up the unrealistic definition of measurement, we can see that lots of things can be measured - all we’re saying is that there is something we can do to reduce our uncertainty about it.[^1]

Turning to the question of which careers have the most potential for impact, there are all kinds of things we could find out that would be relevant to the question: how many people you affect, how good those people say these effects are, how impactful experts say your work is, and so on. These are the ‘measurements’ we could make.

When we measure the good done by a career, there’s much more uncertainty than when we normally measure weight, but it’s just a difference of degree. It doesn’t mean one is measurable and the other is not. In both cases we make observations to reduce uncertainty, and that’s all that we ever mean by measurement.


**2. Not defining what they mean by ‘making a difference.’**

Lots of abstract terms seem immeasurable when we leave them only vaguely defined. ‘Making a difference’ is no different. Left unexpanded, it seems impossible to say which career makes more difference than another. But once you start to really define what you mean by ‘making a difference’, it becomes clearer that the concept can be measured.

For instance, we might think that making a difference has something to do with improving people’s welfare. So, we can immediately see that number of people affected is going to be relevant to how much difference you make. And that’s clearly observable.

Of course, you can debate this definition, but then the problem is no longer with measurement, but with what definition is good enough.


**3. Not knowing what progress has already been made**

People who claim ‘it’s impossible to measure the difference made by different careers’ are often not aware of the progress that has already been made on other relevant questions. Often, there are already answers proposed to relevant questions, and sometimes entire research movements dedicated to answering them.

For instance, the question of which charitable donation makes the most impact has been taken on by [Givewell](http://www.givewell.org) and [Giving What We Can](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org). On a larger scale, the [Copenhagen Consensus](http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/) has brought together some of the world’s top economists to assess which government policies could have the most positive impact on development.

Psychologists and economists have worked extensively on the question of what leads people to have happy and satisfying lives. This has involved creating ‘measures’ of life satisfaction, and then working out what kinds of life changes have the biggest effect on satisfaction. This is a big part in estimating which interventions lead to the most people with the most satisfied lives, a big part of estimating which careers are best.

Knowing about these efforts makes the idea of comparing careers in terms of impact immediately more tractable.


**4. Thinking measurement is possible in principle, but too costly to be worth it in practice**

More precisely - the value of information from measuring the impact of different careers isn’t high enough to justify the costs. This is a sensible thought, that might turn out to be well founded. But so far we haven’t seen claims of this sort justified with real back of the envelope value of information calculations.

On the contrary, since careers seem to differ a huge amount in impact, there’s a lot of value making just very slightly better choices about them. Moreover, since no-one has vigorously taken on the project of comparing careers in terms of impact before, there doesn’t seem to be any reason to think there aren’t useful discoveries that can be made with relatively little effort. So, it seems like we should expect high value of information for little cost.


**5. Thinking that what counts as making a difference in a career completely depends on the individual’s values**

We attempt to provide general statements about the potential value of different careers. But, so the objection goes, what’s valuable depends on the individual.

Well, firstly, that’s a controversial thesis in ethics. Some philosophers hold that value is an objective thing to be discovered. Others hold that it’s purely subjective. Raising this objection means taking sides in a controversial debate.

Secondly, even if it does depend on the individual, peoples’ values tend to overlap quite heavily in reality. We can all agree that, all else equal, saving lives is good and causing suffering is bad. This means that, although differences in value exist, there’s quite a bit we can usefully say about the value of different careers in general. And when it really does come down to a value judgement over which people reasonably disagree, we can just flag that decision point, rather than give up on the whole project.


**6. It’s impossible to compare the value of different options**

The thought is that different careers result in different kinds of outcomes, and that it’s impossible to weigh these options against each other. For instance, one career saves lives while another contributes to artistic culture. How could these possibly be compared?

This idea that some values are ultimately incomparable (or incommensurable in philosopher language) is again a controversial thesis in ethics with many arguments on either side. So saying that some values are incomparable is not an easy end to the debate.

More to the point, in reality we *have* to make trade-offs between different options. Your selection of one career over another is implicitly a judgement that one is better than the other. To do otherwise is just to choose [randomly or thoughtlessly](http://80000hours.org/blog/4-estimation-is-the-best-we-have).


**7. It’s measurable in principle, but there are more important things to focus on right now**

This is strikes me as one of the most sensible objections. The idea is that although 80,000 Hours could focus on assessing the impact of different careers, we could get more value from investigating something else.  In a recent interview, [Holden](http://80000hours.org/blog/172-interview-with-holden-karnofsky-co-founder-of-givewell) suggested that we focus more on evaluating how to get a good person-job fit rather than on immediate social impact. This is a tough question, depending on judgements about the relative ease of investigating the two things, and how much value you get out of the corresponding reductions in uncertainty. Our current best guess is that it’s worth us doing some work on comparing the social impact of different careers, but we’ll constantly assess whether our efforts might be better spent elsewhere.

* * *

So those were the seven objections which I think most commonly lie behind our project to assess the potential for impact of different careers, and why I think they’re mistaken.[^2] I hope our most convincing rebuttal will be demonstrating that the project is possible by
actually doing it! Stay tuned for more on that over the next couple of months.

This post is a quick summary of the workshop: what we covered, what career changes it led to, and how it was received by our attendees.

The workshop took place in mid-July in the Welsh countryside, at the [Centre for Effective Altruism’s](http://centreforeffectivealtruism.net) (CEA) weekend away. Over 60 current and former volunteers and staff of CEA came to take part in workshops, receive training and attend talks on various topics in effective altruism. All day on Saturday, 80,000 Hours ran the career workshop. We had sixteen keen people work with us on making a concrete improvement to their next career decision.[^1]

*Atlantic College, where the weekend away was held*

#What we covered

Our aim was to get people to create a personal career plan, to improve their plan over the course of the day and to go away with concrete actions which to take after the weekend was over. The workshop consisted of a series of presentations and discussions, as well as breaks for writing down of thoughts and ideas.

In the presentations, we went over our latest thoughts on how to choose a career in which you can have the biggest possible impact. This included a section on how to choose which problem to work towards solving with your career (which we call your **cause**). We presented a framework for choosing between different causes and our current best-guess ranking of which causes are most important. Stay tuned to the blog to hear about this in more detail.

We also presented our [framework for choosing between specific career options](http://80000hours.org/blog/238-how-to-assess-the-impact-of-a-career). We then used the framework to explain which careers we currently think allow you to make the biggest difference.

Finally, we raised and discussed key issues, including how personal considerations affect choice of both cause and career, and how to prioritise between having an impact now versus [keeping your options open](http://80000hours.org/blog/233-how-important-is-keeping-your-options-open) to have more impact later.

#Key takeaways for attendees
The things that attendees reported as key takeaways from the workshop were:
* The usefulness of focusing on concrete, tractable questions when trying to make career decisions.
* That **[career capital](http://80000hours.org/blog/238-how-to-assess-the-impact-of-a-career)** is really important: many attendees had previously neglected career capital altogether, or they assumed that they would stay in the same job or sector in which they started in.
* That it is easy to slip into the attitude of trying to find the one right answer to what career you should pursue, rather than coming up with next steps, and [developing a **flexible plan**](http://80000hours.org/blog/237-your-career-is-like-a-startup).
* One cause that most people hadn’t considered before is **global prioritisation**. We will be writing more about this cause in the future. (For now, see the [section on prioritisation](http://80000hours.org/cost-effectiveness-research-and-prioritisation) from an old part of our site).
* Another cause that many people hadn’t heard of and were interested in is [**meta-research**](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/06/06/meta-research-update/). 
* The importance of **transferable skills**: for some people it hadn’t previously sunk in that they should consider these more explicitly when choosing between options and some decided to intentionally improve specific transferable skills.

#Career plan changes
Below are the changes that attendees made to their career plans during the course of the workshop.[^2]
 
For **causes** the biggest change was a large number of people increasing their confidence in the importance of (1) promoting [effective altruism](http://effective-altruism.com/) and (2) of doing global prioritisation research. In addition, some people increased their confidence in the importance of global health, some in the importance existential risk mitigation and many resolved to do much more research and thinking about cause selection than they had previously done. 

For **careers** the changes were as follows: four people added [**entrepreneurship**](http://80000hours.org/blog/23-entrepreneurship-a-game-of-poker-not-roulette) as an option to their plans or increased their confidence in it being a good option, four people added [**project management**](http://80000hours.org/blog/235-looking-for-a-seriously-high-impact-job-using-your-managerial-skills) or increased their confidence in it, and four people added working for, or setting up, **effective altruist organisations** as an option. Other changes included a person adding working in **foundations** as a long term option to their plan, another decreased their confidence that academia is the best option for them and another started giving more consideration to non-programming careers.

The following **next steps** were either new to people’s plans, or people increased their degree of confidence in them: 
* Find out more about transferable skills.
* Apply for a job with the [Copenhagen Consensus](http://80000hours.org/blog/235-looking-for-a-seriously-high-impact-job-using-your-managerial-skills).
* Try a job in law or management
* Do an internship with big name company
* Actively create [networking opportunities](http://80000hours.org/blog/175-how-important-is-networking-for-career-success)
* Do a PhD in philosophy
* Do major research into jobs and contacts who can help with getting jobs
* Try delegating a significant part of current work to free up time for higher value activities
* Learn to pitch op-eds
* Take a job in international development research



#Feedback

In terms of **content**, many people said that our frameworks for choosing causes and [careers](http://80000hours.org/blog/238-how-to-assess-the-impact-of-a-career) were useful because they pulled together the relevant factors in one place, and gave a checklist to work through when assessing options. People also liked combining the frameworks with examples and practicing applying them with someone else, and they also liked seeing our lists of best careers and our rank ordering of causes (one person said they liked getting “causes on a platter”). 
We got really useful feedback which helped us identify at which points in our presentations people would like more detailed explanations, at which points they’d like more examples, and which terms people found unfamiliar. For example, one thing we want to improve next time is spending more time explaining the link between causes and careers.

In terms of the **format** and the way the workshop was run, many attendees explicitly made the point that the environment was one in which people felt they could speak and say what they really thought. A number of people said that getting to actually write down their career plans made a big difference to them. Many people also really liked the interactive parts of the day and suggested that we have even more of them, with shorter presentations.

One thing we are likely to do differently next time is have even fewer people, so that the group is small enough for more in depth discussion. We also want to try out giving people more time to think on their own, as some people said they wanted this.

We are excited to do more iterations of career workshops and do more testing on how they compare in effectiveness with our usual [one-on-one coaching](http://80000hours.org/get-coaching).[^3]

#Follow up

We’re soon going to do a follow up with the people who came to our workshop to see how they are getting on. We’ll ask them if they’ve taken any of the next steps they identified at the workshops, what they feel like they need help with, and encourage and motivate them to continue striving to have the biggest possible impact with their careers!

*Notes*

[^1]: This was just over our initially intended target of fifteen people. We’re pleased that people wanted to work on their career plans instead of joining others in outdoor activities like climbing, archery and mountain boarding!
[^2]: We asked participants to write down a full career plan at the start of the workshop. This included their views on which causes they should work on, and which careers and next steps they think are best. We also asked them to indicate their confidence in each option. At the end of the workshop, participants wrote down a second full career plan, taking into account things they found out in the day. Looking at the differences between the two plans allowed us to see what changes the workshop resulted in for each individual. All in all, fourteen out sixteen attendees made some change to career plan.
[^3]: We plan to do another workshop over a weekend in Oxford over the next six months, though potentially sooner. We’ll keep experimenting until we find the best model.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>ô</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2013-08-16 11:30:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status></item><item><title>Does money make you happy?</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/53-does-money-make-you-happy</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[If we’re to believe the Internet, [various apologists](http://quotationsbook.com/quote/27092/) [for materialism](http://snigdhakrishna.com/money-happiness) [have](http://quotationsbook.com/quote/27092/) [quipped](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/106119) [that](http://www.girlnextdoorfashion.net/2010/08/whoever-said-that-money-doesnt-buy.html) whoever said money can’t buy happiness didn’t know where to shop. Indeed, the happiness of others can be bought at bargain-basement prices with a donation to an effective charity. If you’re thinking of donating a substantial portion of your income, though, it's natural to wonder how your well-being will be affected. What can research tell us about this?

We first need to clarify what is meant by ‘well-being’. I'm going to focus on emotional well-being, the balance of positive and negative emotions that a person is experiencing at any given time. (This is to be contrasted with life evaluation, which is how people evaluate their lives when asked to reflect on them.) Though I’m going to focus on a single research paper, much what I say applies to other correlational studies of income and well-being.)

In [a 2010 paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489.full), Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton analyzed survey data from 450,000 Americans and found that emotional well-being - a composite of positive affect, stress, and feeling blue - was related to income. Much of the media coverage focused on the fact that income and emotional well-being were correlated only up to £50,000 a year. For example, the _Telegraph_'s [article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/7984511/50000-a-year-can-buy-you-happiness-after-that-its-down-to-you.html) claimed that emotional well-being ‘only rose steadily with annual income up to [a] level—$75,000, or just below £50,000.’

This is right but misleading. Most people would interpret ‘rise steadily’ to mean that for a given increase in income, emotional well-being would increase by a certain amount. For example, the difference between the happiness of someone in a household that earns £30,000 a year and someone in a household that earns £20,000 a year would be the same as that between someone in a household that earns £50,000 a year and someone in a household that earns £40,000 a year.

But the researchers meant something else: that happiness rose steadily with _log_ income up to £50,000 a year. This means that changes in emotional well-being were correlated with changes in relative, not absolute, income. So the gap in well-being between someone whose family earns £40,000 a year and someone whose family earns £20,000 a year is similar to the gap between someone whose household earns £20,000 a year and someone whose household earns £10,000 a year. Looking at the graph below, you can see that moving from $80,000 to $40,000 (£51,000 to £25,000) results in only a small decline in ‘positive affect’ and ‘not feeling blue’ and no change in stress. (I might write about life evaluation - the ‘ladder’ line in the graph below - in another article.)
So there is a positive correlation between income and well-being, though it weakens as income increases and disappears entirely after £50,000 a year is reached. This fact alone doesn’t relate directly to how giving would affect your well-being because giving money to charity doesn’t decrease your income. In fact, thanks to government policies that encourage donations (gift aid in the UK and itemized tax deductions in the US), charitable giving in effect increases your income. But even if you believe that the money you give to charity is, with regard to your well-being, money thrown out the window, it doesn’t follow that income actually causes well-being. Many factors that presumably affect well-being - health, job security, social status - are correlated with income.

Consider Zoila the surgeon and Hortencia the cleaner. Zoila makes eight times as much money as Hortencia, but Zoila donates much of her income to charity, so she has the same amount of money to spend on herself and her family that Hortencia does. Hortencia smokes. Despite having similar disposable incomes, Hortencia's financial situation is much less secure: she has credit-card debt and lives paycheck-to-paycheck, while Zoila has six months’ living expenses set aside. Zoila has valuable knowledge that will help her keep her job, while Hortencia's employment is more replaceable. Zoila's work is interesting and her occupation offers her status, while Hortencia's work is repetitive and is not appreciated by society. It seems that Zoila would be happier than Hortencia despite their having the same amount of money to spend on themselves and their families. 

Finally, £50,000 a year - the level beyond which emotional well-being doesn’t improve - is a low figure relative to the salaries offered by many careers. What is more, the figure refers to household, not individual, income. Most married couples in the US have two earners, so the per-earner threshold is even lower than £50,000. Let’s say that you believe that the relation between income and emotional well-being up to £50,000 is causal and strong enough to dissuade giving more. If you pursue a high-earning career, you could still give tens of thousands of pounds a year while keeping at least £50,000 a year to spend on yourself and your family.

Right now, research can't settle the question of how giving affects happiness - but you can! If you are ambivalent about giving more, I suggest that you simply try it for a few months. If you find that giving an additional, say, five percent of your income is unbearable, you can always revert to your previous level. But you will probably find yourself no worse off, and those whom you help will find themselves much better off.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>5</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2012-09-18 21:37:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>538</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Robbie Shade</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>robbie.shade@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/robbie-shade</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-09-19 20:05:25</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[> Looking at the graph below, you can see that moving from $80,000 to $40,000

He is quite drunk and looking for something under a lamppost. “What are you looking for?” asks the policeman. “My keys,” the man replies, pointing down the road a little way, “I dropped them over there.” The policeman is baffled, “Then why are you looking for them here?”. “Because there’s no light over there.”

The joke is old but it gets to the heart of the debate over quantification. Is it best to look for keys under lampposts? Quantification lets us use a whole host of numerical tools to understand problems and develop solutions to them. But as I discussed [last time](http://80000hours.org/blog/79-quantification-part-2-the-dangers) there are dangers in using such tools on the wrong kinds of goals. In this way quantification is like the lamppost. It lets you see far more clearly what is going on, but only in some limited areas.

So what kinds of things tell us how good an idea it is to look under lampposts? (Or what kinds of problems should we use quantitative methods on).

* How many near misses there are. I’ll discuss this below.
* How bright the light is. i.e. how much information does this tool give you.
* Where you think you dropped the keys. i.e. if you suspect that the thing you are looking for cannot be analysed by these methods then don’t use them.

Last time we dealt with the biases and limitations around quantitative methods. With all these in mind we might think it at least possible that in fact the best interventions will be generally not quantifiable. We might think that the revolutionary overthrow of governments or some other project, is on average the best project; despite it being of high and almost impossible to quantify risk. I want to argue that even if you think that the best things aren’t under lampposts it can still be best to look there.

**You can only do so much, so make it count.**

The key fact in any intervention is that we have finite resources. You have only so many hours, only so much money, only so many favours you can call in. But there are many projects, there are 170,000 registered charities in the UK alone. And these are far from equally good. In health there are interventions out there that are [1000 times](http://www.dcp2.org/page/main/BrowseInterventions.html) less effective than others.  It isn’t like looking for one key, it’s like looking for the best thing you can find when you can only carry so much.

Imagine the street holds not keys but banknotes of all denominations. We can imagine there being a few $1000 bills in amongst the many $1 bills. Suppose you can only carry so many notes (you have only so many hours to work in a day). Now it most likely does make sense to look under a lamppost. If you look in the dark you pick up a random selection, a handful of notes with lots of $1s and a few $20s. If you look under a streetlamp you pick up only the $1000 bills. In fact, for it to make any sense to look in the dark you’d have to expect more than just the bills over there to be worth more on average. You’d have to expect those notes to be worth more than the very best notes under the lamppost.

The point is that however much quantitative methods limit our focus they let us pick things that are vastly more effective than the average. Other methods might promise a dramatic effect in some cases but quantitative methods promise to give you the best intervention of one type almost every time. For it to make sense to reject quantitative methods we’d have to expect that the *average* intervention from the non-quantitative camp would be better than the *best* method in the quantitative camp.

*X-axis: Effectiveness*
*Y-axis: Number of interventions*

<br>

Interventions are often distributed like a highly skewed log-normal distribution, a small number are vastly better than others. Choosing the best intervention is a very significant gain.

**How good are the alternatives?**

The next question is how much more information we get out of quantitative methods compared to other intuitive, philosophical or categorical tools. This is hard to measure exactly as, by definition, non-quantitative tools resist analysis of their effectiveness. But we do know that without care human thinking is riddled with biases and bad heuristic thinking. Most people will spend [just as much money](http://www.rti.org/pubs/bk-0001-1009_web.pdf) to save 2000 or 200,000 birds from an oil spill. This is typical of how we think. This means that interventions which seem intuitively good end up having [no effect or even causing harm](http://80000hours.org/blog/66-social-interventions-gone-wrong).

Different philosophical schools or other non-quantitative tools of analysis are not obviously good at combating these biases. Consider economics, academics who use non-quantitative approaches are as varied as Marxists and Friedmanites. There is nowhere close to this diversity in quantitative econometrics. Which begs the question of how confident the Friedmanite can realistically be that they are even close to a right answer. The light of quantification is
 very bright indeed.

**Final thought:**

For a non-quantifiable intervention to be a sensible choice we have to be confident that we do not need the bright light of quantification. What interventions from hard to quantify areas like political lobbying do you expect to be 1000 times more effective than a typical measure in something like public health? Comments are open for thoughts on that or any other part of this post.

Thanks for a thought-provoking series of posts. I read the above with particular interest. Here’s my attempt at a critical response.

You write:

(C) "For it to make sense to reject quantitative methods we’d have to expect that the average intervention from the non-quantitative camp would be better than the best method in the quantitative camp."

I think this is wrong. In the previous sentence, you write:

"Other methods might promise a dramatic effect in some cases but quantitative methods promise to give you the best intervention of one type almost every time."

I want to pick up on the “almost every time” here. I think you only get to (C) by playing down the error rate associated with the selection and implementation of quantitative methods (you seem to treat it as negligible). The lamppost analogy gives the impression that identifying the best quantitative methods is like taking candy from a baby - but clearly, it isn’t. We should imagine the lamp as an old fluorescent bulb, that flickers quite a lot, and so introduces a non-trivial error rate in our ability to pick up the most valuable dollar bills. Bear this in mind, and (C) looks much too strong. 

It may be that we have to reformulate (C) as weakly as: 

(C2) For it to make sense to reject quantitative methods we’d have to expect that the average intervention from the non-quantitative camp would be better than the average method in the quantitative camp.

This is a bit of a truism, but its still a decent challenge for the advocate of a non-quantitative approach. In some cases it could well be enough to generate the conclusion you’re aiming for. But I certainly don’t think that your argument against non-quantiative methods is strong enough to establish a general conclusion in favour of a quantitative approach. The regrettably brief argument you develop isn't much more than an intuition pump (rather ironic, given the target) and invites the standard response to scepticism: the fact that our intuitions are sometimes misleading doesn’t mean we should radically distrust them.

In short, I think the lamp is prone to flickering, and the darkness is not as absolute as you suggest.

##Summary

</br>

It is often claimed that philanthropists do more harm earning money than good making donations. We saw [this idea](http://www.benkuhn.net/etg-objections) raised many times during the recent [press coverage](http://80000hours.org/blog/227-80-000-hours-in-the-washington-post-our-responses-to-the-coverage) of [Earning to Give](/earning-to-give). Our response is that although the objection may be true for [typical examples of philanthropy](http://blog.givewell.org/2009/12/14/charity-isnt-about-helping/), when donors are [giving effectively](http://www.givewell.org/) it's difficult for the expected harm to outweigh the good done by the donations. 

In this post, I make some very rough estimates of how harmful finance would have to be in order for it to outweigh the good done by the donations of someone Earning to Give to effective charities.

#The Direct Harm

</br>

###Introduction
</br>

Left leaning advocates sometimes claim that Bill Gates did more harm through the Windows monopoly than good through his charity work. On the other hand, [some on the right](http://www.parapundit.com/archives/007256.html) claim that he did more good with Windows than with charity. Both views are implausible.

I’ll focus on the first claim, that the Windows monopoly did more harm than the Gates Foundation managed to do good, since this is the more common type of objection we find raised about Earning to Give. The vaccination programs of the Gates Foundation alone [are estimated](http://geekologie.com/2012/01/bill-gates-is-better-than-batman-the-inf.php) to have saved around 6 million lives to date, and this number is expected to rise significantly in the future. Windows has had [800 million](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-2001697/Microsofts-Bill-Gates-A-rare-remarkable-interview-worlds-second-richest-man.html) users to date. This means that in order for Gates to have caused more harm through Windows, using Windows would have to be worse than making a person in poverty play a 1-in-100 [Russian roulette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_roulette). Microsoft might be annoying, but it’s not that bad.

###Zero-sum games
</br>

What about other cases? It seems likely that many industries involve zero-sum elements, which use up human effort with creating value for society. For instance, it [has been claimed](http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/2011/11/18/closing-wall-streets-casino/) that certain types of financial speculation are just gambling. One side wins and the other side loses. No value is created. Similarly with corporate law, escalating amounts of resources are spent aiming to win cases, when mutual disarmament might deliver the same results without enormous legal costs. In both cases, it’s tough to show that these industries actually create no value. Some level of speculation leads to more efficient markets. Some level of competition is probably required in order to have a functioning legal system. Even if we assume that they indeed do not create any value, that is not a robust enough argument to show that pursuing a legal career and doing significant effective philanthropy is net harmful; in order to make this case, one would need to show that the industry is causing harm on a large scale. Here are some calculations to show roughly how large the harm would have to be for such a claim to be substantiated.

###Harm outweighing the good in finance?
</br>

**Estimate 1**

Finance is often taken to be the legal high earning career that’s most harmful to society. The average Goldman Sachs employee earns around [$500,000 per year](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-16/at-goldman-the-average-pay-for-3-months-is-135-594). If someone joined Goldman and donated half of his earnings to Against Malaria Foundation, that would be about enough to save [100 lives per year](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#Costperlifesaved) (or more accurately, saving 4000 QALYs), plus likely have substantial positive [flow-through effects](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/)[^5]. For Earning to Give at Goldman to be net harmful, the marginal employee would need to be causing the death of a hundred people each year. This would mean that Goldman Sachs employees are several orders of magnitude more deadly than American service people in Iraq.[^1]

Goldman has [32,000 employees](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-16/at-goldman-the-average-pay-for-3-months-is-135-594). An upper bound for the harm caused by the marginal employee is thus the total harm caused divided by 32,000. For the harm to outweigh the good, Goldman would therefore have to be killing at least 3.2 million young people each year, or doing something else that is similarly harmful. That would mean that Goldman Sachs would need to be responsible for around 5% of all deaths in the world.[^2] Bear in mind that Goldman Sachs only makes up [22% of American investment banking](http://www.economist.com/node/21563770), and 3% of the American financial industry[^3] - if the rest of finance is similarly bad, then it would imply that finance is doing something as bad as causing *all* the deaths in the world.

This is an upper bound, if we assume the Givewell estimate of cost per life saved won’t go down, because (i) Goldman’s activities will likely have some diminishing marginal returns (ii) there will be some level of replacement of Goldman employees. By (i), I mean that the 32,000th banker will have less impact than the rest of them. That’s because the marginal bankers will have to take worse profit opportunities than the others, because the bankers will take the best opportunities first. If Goldman’s harm is roughly proportional to its level of profit, then the marginal bankers will be much less harmful than the average banker.[^4] By (ii), I mean that if someone turns down a job at Goldman, Goldman [will take some actions to compensate for that loss](http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/01/22/replaceability/), for instance they’ll hire other people. This will probably result in a significant proportion of the harmful impact occurring anyway.

**Estimate 2**

Let’s consider the American financial industry in general. Upcoming Giving What We Can research estimates that it would take $200 billion a year to move everyone in the world above the $1.25 poverty line. That figure will only be $74 billion in 2030. The employees of the financial sector could do this if they transferred (e.g. via GiveDirectly) 30-75% of their salaries to those in extreme global poverty (depending on what date you want to achieve the goal by)[^6]. In other words, if everyone in finance were Earning to Give, it would be possible to end extreme global poverty within the next twenty years.[^7] Harm would only dominate if the financial sector is doing something roughly as bad as single handedly causing all global poverty.

For an individual doing Earning to Give at the margin, the situation is even better, and the levels of harm would have to be even worse to get outweighing. They’ll be doing less harm due to replaceability, and can do more good since they can pick better donation opportunities than would be available if that huge amount of money were being spent on aid.

I find it implausible that finance is causing this much harm. The most strident critics of finance claim that the [financial crisis will result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and around 100 million extra in poverty](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/08/bankster-fraud-is-not-a-victimless-crime-it-has-driven-100-million-into-poverty-killing-millions.html). The crisis is often regarded as the most harmful effect of the financial industry in recent times. But we’ve shown that if everyone in the financial sector were doing Earning to Give, it could save millions of lives and move *everyone*out of extreme poverty - far greater positive impact than the harm done by the crisis. And (i) it’s difficult to claim that the people in the financial sector were wholly responsible for the crisis (ii) we’ve totally ignored any of the positive effects of finance. [This post](http://infoproc.blogspot.co.uk/2009/07/against-finance.html) points out that the financial sector would only need to increase annual GDP growth by 0.1% in order to offset a financial crisis every twenty years that costs 15% of GDP.


#Doing good in finance
</br>

It may even be that many people pursuing Earning to Give in unethical industries have a net positive impact in their work. That’s because bringing more ethically motivated people into finance seems likely to make it more socially beneficial. 

All you need to do is to create less harm than your less ethically motivated replacement. For that, it just needs to be possible to turn down some opportunities to do harm. For instance, much of the harm caused by finance in the last crisis seems to have come from [fraudulent](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/janet-tavakoli/fraud-as-a-business-model_b_950806.html) activities in packaging mortage debt. If you were working in this sector, but didn’t engage in (as much) fraud you could have reduced how bad it was. Of course, there would have been pressures on you to earn more, which may have made it difficult to avoid and keep your job, but it seems unlikely there was *nothing* you could have done. Alternatively, there seem to be [ways to reduce the harms of finance](http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/CP%2B-%2BFinancial%2BInstability%2BFINISHED.pdf). By advocating for these reforms from within, you might have some scope to improve finance from the inside.

###The whistleblower escape hatch
</br>

If you find yourself involved in something that’s really harmful, then there’s always the option to quit, and perhaps even to do some good on the way by becoming a whistleblower.

There have [been many whistleblowers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_whistleblowers) who have played a vital role in uncovering massive scandals. A recent financial example is Sherron Watkins, who played a major role in bringing down Enron.

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/208/original/sherronwatkins.jpg?1375723574'><img alt="Sherronwatkins" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/208/large/sherronwatkins.jpg?1375723574" /></a>

>In August 2001, Sherron Watkins, then Enron's vice president for corporate development, sent an explosive, seven-page email to the energy company's CEO, Kenneth Lay. She detailed what she called an "[elaborate accounting hoax](https://umdrive.memphis.edu/jturner1/www/ACCT7241/Articles/Sherron%20Watkins%20eMail%20to%20Enron%20Chairman%20Kenneth%20Lay.pdf)," which included inflating income and hiding epic losses. Although Lay claimed that he'd launch an investigation, Watkins said that she was immediately punished; her computer's hard drive was confiscated and her desk relocated to the nether regions of Enron. [Four months later](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/enron-files-for-bankruptcy), Enron could no longer sustain the fraud, and it filed for bankruptcy.

(quoting from [here](http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2013/06/12/famous-whistle-blowers-snowden/#!slide=5954390))

With whistleblowing, the more severe the harm being done in the industry, the more impact you have! Whistleblowers are rare and often have an outsized impact.

#Other objections

##It’s all signalling
</br>

An alternative source of harm from doing Earning to Give is signalling your support for a harmful or suboptimal system. This could have an effect on the actions of others, which leads to negative effects, in particular, it makes it harder to fundamentally change the system.

I think this effect is likely to be very small in most cases. First, I doubt many people will be strongly influenced if someone they know enters finance or law. It’s a widely accepted path that lots of people already take, and they generally take it in order to get the large salary rather than because they were influenced by their friends.

Second, it seems possible to mitigate the negative signalling (if you think this is an issue) by telling people “I don’t support the system, but I think that engaging with the system is currently the best way for me to make the world better.”

Third, doing Earning to Give has positive signalling effects too. In particular, you’re promoting the ideas of (i) spending lots of your income to good causes rather than spending on it luxury goods and (ii) effective giving. These signals seem much stronger than the negative ones. We’ve seen concrete examples of one person’s donations leading to others.

I expand on these effects more from section 5.3. of [this document](http://www.academia.edu/1807196/Which_Ethical_Careers_Make_a_Difference_The_Replaceability_Issue_in_the_Ethics_of_Career_Choice).


##Collective action
</br>

A related worry is that considering Earning to Give might lead to a failure of collective action, in which lots of people end up propagating a system that is sub-optimal when a much better option was on the table. We address this objection [here](http://80000hours.org/blog/61-collective-action-working-in-unethical-industries-part-2). The quick answer is that only happens if effective altruists coordinate badly. As effective altruists become more numerous, it’s seem far more likely that coordination will be good enough that they’ll be able to solve these big problems, rather than get stuck in a situation where all the investment banks are filled with people doing Earning to Give but the system is unchanged.


##Could you do more good elsewhere?
</br>

An objection to Earning to Give that seems much more plausible is that taking a high earning job in order to donate more involves giving up an even better opportunity to do good. It’s implausible that the harm done within high earning jobs is greater than the good done by effective donations, but it might be *even better* to work in a more socially beneficial job but donate less. For this to be true, the extra good you do in socially beneficial jobs (compared to non-beneficial high earning jobs) would have to be significantly larger than the good done by the extra donations you could make. 

We’re highly uncertain about for which jobs this is the case. In the past, we have advised effective altruists with a particularly strong comparative advantage for earning money to go into Earning to Give, while we’ve advised others to go into jobs that directly do good in [effective cause](/causes) areas.

There may be other situations when it is better not to do Earning to Give. For instance, if you think boosting economic productivity is highly important, then it might be a mistake to swap entrepreneurship or engineering (which presumably increase society’s wealth significantly) for finance or law (which presumably don’t help nearly as much) in order to earn slightly more. We’re planning to write more about this soon.

All told, the question of who can make the most difference through Earning to Give seems very unsettled. See this post for some of the [arguments against pursuing Earning to Give](http://80000hours.org/blog/191-why-earning-to-give-is-often-not-the-best-option).

The way I think about it is if Microsoft was anti-competitive, then they've slowed down innovation in their field. This means they've delayed the arrival of better software. The harm done would be the value lost due to having worse PC software over the time they've delayed its arrival. 

Just to use some example figures in an extremely simple model: suppose you think having worse PC software cost 0.1% of GDP, and Microsoft slowed down the field by 10 years, then the cost would be 0.1% x GDP x 10.

Note that this could be much larger than Microsoft's revenues.

Has Microsoft actually done much harm like this? I think it's very difficult to say. Some of Microsoft's contributions have been innovative and have sped up the sector. Others might have slowed it down. The point of the post is that just to offset Gates' donations, you'd have the be pretty confident the harm was very large.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>1268</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1270</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Tim Dettmers</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>tim.dettmers@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/tim-dettmers</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-08-14 07:02:04</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Even if Microsoft has slowed down innovation, I think it was critical to grant people easy, quick access to the computer. The first years of Microsoft had such a large impact on society and the world that the later years do not really matter. I do not think that Microsoft was all too good altogether, but the things which stemmed indirectly from Microsoft were inherently good.

If there were no Microsoft, then the spread of the internet would have been slowed down dramatically (no Microsoft Windows); also globalization would have been slower (no Microsoft Windows, Office, no widespread internet). The result? Poorer nations would not have developed as fast (e.g. China, India); social equality would be worse (no information equality due to Google, Wikipedia etc.; no Arab Spring etc.). Probably this community would not exist expect for locally around Oxford.

Of course other operating systems and software would have been developed and replaced the missing spots, but it would just have been much slower. It is like saying if the Green Revolution would have been delayed by 5 or 10 years it would have been okay — it would not have been okay, it would have been a disaster with millions of people suffering from malnutrition unnecessarily.

Their existence is symptomatic of that inequality, but Goldman's influence in particular is great in the US government, one of the chief enforcers of that inequality. Moreover, it is legally obligated to maximize shareholder returns, a goal utterly at odds with the goal of reducing inequality through dismantling unjust international arrangements. As alluded to in the post, Goldman also creates net harm by externalizing many costs on to third parties (as in the crisis), enabling it to generate larger rates of return.

This is partially addressed here: "...the financial sector would only need to increase annual GDP growth by 0.1% in order to offset a financial crisis every twenty years that costs 15% of GDP."

However, this contention is irresponsible; it makes the financial industry look like it's contributing to GDP in the absence of solid empirical evidence. Quantitative measures of the financial industry's impact rarely take into account the externalities they cause.

Finally, this post assumes that the the relationship between an EA and an institution like Goldman only goes one way: I think it's plausible that the noxious corporate culture at a place like Goldman might demoralize or alienate an EA, causing them to burn out or give up.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1257</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Benjamin Todd</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>benjamin.john.todd@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/benjamin-todd</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-08-05 21:38:41</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[>However, this contention is irresponsible; it makes the financial industry look like it’s contributing to GDP in the absence of solid empirical evidence. 

The point I'm trying to make is that it's highly non-obvious that lightly regulated finance is even net harmful (let alone so bad that it makes earning to give not worthwhile). I think the burden of proof is on the critics to show that finance as it exists now doesn't add significantly more to GDP than it takes away. It would only take a 0.1ppt p.a. boost to offset terrible financial crises every twenty years.

In addition, the main of point of the post is that *even if* a firm like Goldman is net harmful, is has to be *extremely* harmful to come close to offsetting the good done by earning to give. Again, I think the burden of proof is on the critic to show that this much harm is taking place.

> I think it’s plausible that the noxious corporate culture at a place like Goldman might demoralize or alienate an EA, causing them to burn out or give up.

I agree this is a risk. We've written about it before. It's certainly something to monitor, though I think there are plausible ways to reduce the risk and based on people currently pursuing earning to give it doesn't seem to be so bad as to rule out the idea.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>1256</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1260</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Tim Dettmers</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>tim.dettmers@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/tim-dettmers</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-08-06 18:19:47</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think AndrewFM makes some good points why a job at Goldman might be more harmful. I think one can for sure say that the net impact of a job at Goldman's will be positive. The argument gains weight if one thinks in terms of PageRank: The sum of the links from Goldman might in total more harmful than Goldman itself — but it might also be the opposite!

However, it is sufficient to show that the positive impact of a job at Goldman's is less positive than jobs at other firms or in other fields to show that taking a job at Goldman's is not a wise choice. So a comparison of different jobs (a job in engineering vs a job in finance) would yield more tangible information of how good a job a Goldman's really would be.
 
However, it is all a bit theoretical here — it is just really hard so assess what value such a job has, there are just to many fuzzy variables and implications of a job that handles large sums of money. I think Ben did a great job here to bring the most important variable to the surface.

Our most recent research looked at the typical career paths and salaries for five different careers:

* Accounting
* Consulting
* Investment Banking
* Law 
* Medicine. 

We found that investment bankers have the highest earning potential. In the UK, an investment banker can expect to earn between £8 million and £40 million over the course of their career.

You can make more refined estimates for your individual situation by considering a number of personal factors, such as where you live and your ability relative to your peers.

In some upcoming posts, we’ll look at some ways to maximise your earnings within specific careers. We’ll cover entry requirements, the best places to work, and which exit opportunities are the most promising. We will also look at some of the major differences that we’ve found between earnings in the UK and the USA. In this post, we present a summary of our findings.

##So, how much will I earn?

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/155/original/Lifetime_Earnings.png?1369750408'><img alt="Lifetime_earnings" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/155/large/Lifetime_Earnings.png?1369750408" /></a>

Within each of these broad sectors, we chose one specific career - deal making investment bankers, solicitors, management consultants, public accountants and NHS doctors (including both consultants and GPs) - and estimated how much you could earn if you make it all the way to the top of each particular field. The results of our research suggest that, on average, investment bankers have the highest earning potential, with mean lifetime earnings of between £8m and £40m. As you can see from the graph above, this is significantly higher than lawyers at £4.5m-£18m, consultants at £3.5m-£10m, and accountants and doctors with £3m-£9m.

In order to calculate these expected lifetime earnings, we gathered as much information as we could about the typical career paths. For each position we found information on:

* Base salaries
* Bonus sizes
* How long it takes to reach each level

By combining this information we were able to make an [estimate for the lifetime earnings](http://80000hours.org/blog/171-estimation-part-ii-how-much-will-you-earn) across a career.

Our [80% confidence intervals](http://www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/methods/statecounty/ci.html) for mean earnings might appear surprisingly wide, but this is due to a large amount of uncertainty in the data that we are using. This uncertainty is largely due to the fact that performance related pay, such as bonuses and profit shares, forms a significant part of the earnings. This is most prevalent in Investment Banking, which has the largest range, as after the first three years bonuses are frequently larger than the base salaries, and by the time you make it to the Managing Director level they can be worth 10-20 times as much as your base salary in a good year.

##Tailoring these estimates to you

Since our estimates don’t account for individual differences, to get a more accurate estimate you’ll want to factor in considerations about your own personal circumstances. Some of the key factors that will influence your earnings are:

1. **Geography**: Salaries vary depending on whether you work in a major city such as London or whether you work in a regional office. In order to work out how much you can actually donate, you’ll also need to consider the variation in living costs across these areas. An increase in earnings might not actually translate into an increase in the amount you can donate if your living costs increase by the same amount, for example.

2. **Which company you work for**: In most careers the company that you work for can have a big impact on how much you earn. Aiming for [bulge bracket banks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulge_bracket), [magic circle law firms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Circle_(law)) or the [big four accounting firms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_(audit_firms)) can help to boost your earnings. Beyond this, identifying which sector or division you’re likely to end up specialising in can also help narrow down your range of expected earnings. 

3. **Progression Rate**: How quickly you move along your career path will depend upon ability, experience and luck. By looking at some relevant indicators of success for your particular career you will be able to understand how you compare to your peers, enabling you to refine your estimates for how long it will take you to reach the top.

4. **Changes in career path**: Another important thing to consider is both dropout rates at different points of the career path, and where the exit opportunities lie. Obviously not everyone gets to become the CEO one day, and you might need to think about when you are likely to move within or leave an industry. Different levels of seniority can also require drastically different skills, so rather than just assuming you will stick out a career to the end, think about which aspects of the job you are likely to be good at and where this may take you.

When making your own estimate it is important to remember that most of the things we are dealing with aren’t fixed. Job markets, careers, industries will all change between now and the end of your career. Your own abilities and preferences are unlikely to remain unchanged either. Update your models and estimates as you progress through your career, taking account of where you are, what you have learnt and where opportunities are likely to open up in the future. By assessing all this you will be able to periodically examine your career and make better informed choices about when and where to move, leave or jump to.

##Maximising your earnings

In some future posts, we'll look more in depth at maximising earnings in Banking, Medicine, Law, Accounting, and Consulting by considering:

* The minimum entry requirements and how to get in
* Which firms, divisions and sectors offer the highest earnings
* What the exit opportunities are for each career and when you should take them
* Some of the best sources we have found for additional guidance and information.

The organization completely ignores social history, social processes, and social connection. It has no comment on how the rich world became rich (i.e., in part through centuries of exploitation of the poor world) . It doesn't conceive of system change except through political lobbying that ultimately acknowledges the power gradients embedded in the status quo. It embraces paternalism and keeps proffering dubious cost-effectiveness to guilt young people into become bankers. It never mentions an actual dialogue with people in poverty, which is representative of an ideology that doesn't seem to ascribe any agency to anyone except to well-to-do university students who have the privilege of opting into (or out of) a career in finance or law or medicine. It fetishes "evidence" and randomized-controlled trials as though better math is only obstacle to preventing suffering. Its ahistoric and apolitical view of justice reduces morality to buying malarial bed nights.

I think it has some good points, but it still comes from an extremely utilitarian perspective that doesn't mention social etiologies of poverty. My general belief is that much of poverty is rooted in historical power gradients, and any movement that looks to remedy poverty cannot ignore history and political economy (as I think GWWC and 80k Hours generally do).

I still do stand by my assertion that 80k Hours generally advocates earning to give as a baseline approach to doing good. I'm basing this comment on 80k Hours's website and talks I've heard in person by Will. ]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>1167</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1198</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Benjamin Todd</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>benjamin.john.todd@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/benjamin-todd</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-06-26 23:42:45</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[We do think it's a helpful baseline.

It might be worth adding that there's nothing in effective  altruism that makes us intrinsically uninterested in the social etiology of poverty. It's more that we haven't had reason to think that doing that kind of analysis is particularly high leverage right now. Bringing a little more quantification into altruism, however, seems highly neglected. We may be wrong about this. It's likely we'll need to include more understanding of political economy when we start to gain capacity to analyse advocacy interventions.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>1197</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1144</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Andy</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>Sume1971@armyspy.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-06-12 10:30:14</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Jonathan,

Many people might agree that a social change movement is noble yet not want to do anything to promote it, or want to give more money to a charity yet refrain from doing so. Additional moralizing doesn't seem to do the trick. ...So what does?

For a start on the answer, like many things, I turn to psychology. Specifically, the psychology Peter Singer catalogues in his book.

##A Single, Identifiable Victim

<br>

<a href='http://utrechttoastmasters.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/rokia1.png?w=500'><img alt="Formula" class="image medium" src="http://utrechttoastmasters.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/rokia1.png?w=500" /></a>


*"This is seven-year old Rokia. Rokia is desperately poor and her life will be changed for the better by your gift."*

<br>

One of the most well-known motivations behind helping others is a *personal connection*, which triggers empathy. When psychologists researching generosity paid participants to join a psychological experiment and then later gave these participants the opportunity to donate to a global poverty fighting organization [Save the Children](http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.6115947/k.8D6E/Official_Site.htm), two different kinds of information were given.

One random group of participants were told "Food shortages in Malawi are affecting more than three million children" and some additional information about how the need for donations was very strong, and these donations could help stop the food shortages.

Another random group of participants were instead shown the photo of Rokia, a seven-year-old Malawian girl who is desperately poor. The participants were told that "her life will be changed for the better by your gift".

Furthermore, a third random group of participants were shown the photo of Rokia, told about who she is and that "her life will be changed for the better", but ALSO told about the general information about the famine and told the same "food shortages [...] are affecting more than three million" -- a combination of both the previous groups.

Lastly, a fourth random group was shown the photo of Rokia, informed about her the same as the other groups, and then given information about another child, identified by name, and told that their donation would also affect this child too for the better.

**It's All About the Person**

Interestingly, the group who was told ONLY about Rokia gave the most money. The group who was told about both children reported feeling less overall emotion than those who only saw Rokia, and gave less money. The group who was told about both Rokia and the general famine information gave even less than that, followed by the group that only got the general famine information.[^1], [^2]  It turns out that information about a single person was the most salient for creating an empathetic response to trigger a willingness to donate.[^1],[^2] This continues through additional studies. In another generosity experiment, one group of people was told that a single child needed a lifesaving medical treatment that costs $300K, and was given the opportunity to contribute towards this fund. A second random group of people was told that eight children needed a lifesaving treatment, and all of them would die unless $300K could be provided, and was given an opportunity to contribute. More people opted to donate toward the single child.[^3], [^4]

This is the basis for why we're so willing to chase after [lost miners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Copiap%C3%B3_mining_accident) or [Baby Jessica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_McClure) no matter the monetary cost, but turn a blind eye to the mass unknown starving in the developing world.  Indeed, the person doesn't even need to be particularly identified, though it does help. In another experiment, people asked by researchers to make a donation to Habitat for Humanity were more likely to do so if they were told that the family "has been selected" rather than that they "will be selected" -- even though all other parts of the pitch were the same, and the participants got no information about who the families actually were [^5].

**The Deliberative and The Affective**

Why is this the case? Researcher Paul Slovic thinks that humans have two different processes for deciding what to do. The first is an *affective system* that responds to emotion, rapidly processing images and stories and generating an intuitive feeling that leads to immediate action. The second is a *deliberative system* that draws on reasoning, and operates on words, numbers, and abstractions, which is much slower to generate action.[^6]

To follow up, the Rokia experiment was done again, except yet another twist was added -- there were two groups, one told only about Rokia exactly as before, and one told only the generic famine information exactly as before. Within each group, half the group took a survey designed to arouse their emotions by asking them things like "When you hear the word 'baby' how do you feel?" The other half of both groups was given emotionally neutral questions, like math puzzles.

This time, the Rokia group gave far more, but those in the group who randomly had their emotions aroused gave even more than those who heard about Rokia but had finished math problems. On the other side, those who heard the generic famine information showed no increase in donation regardless of how heightened their emotions were.[^1]

 
##Futility and Making a Difference



Imagine you're told that there are 3000 refugees at risk in a camp in Rwanda, and you could donate towards aid that would save 1500 of them. Would you do it? And how much would you donate?

Now this time imagine that you can still save 1500 refugees with the same amount of money, but the camp has 10000 refugees. In an experiment where these two scenarios were presented not as a thought experiment but as realities to two separate random groups, the group that heard of only 3000 refugees were more likely to donate, and donated larger amounts.[^7], [^8]

Enter another quirk of our giving psychology, right or wrong: *futility thinking*. We think that if we're not making a sizable difference, it's not worth making the difference at all -- it will only be a drop in the ocean and the problem will keep raging on.

 

##Am I Responsible?



People are also far less likely to help if they're with other people. In this experiment, students were invited to participate in a market research survey. However, when the researcher gave the students their questionnaire to fill out, she went into a back room separated from the office only by a curtain. A few minutes later, noises strongly suggested that she had got on a chair to get something from a high shelf, and then fell off it, loudly complaining that she couldn't feel or move her foot.

With only one student taking the survey, 70% of them stopped what they were doing and offered assistance. However, when there were two students taking the survey, this number dropped down dramatically. Most noticeably, when the group was two students -- but one of the students was a stooge who was in on it and would always not respond, the response rate of the non-stooge participant was only 7%.[^9]

This one is known as *diffusion of responsibility*, better known as *the bystander effect* -- we help more often when we think it is our responsibility to do so, and -- again for right or for wrong -- we naturally look to others to see if they're helping before doing so ourselves.



##Conclusions



What can we do to encourage people to help more?

1. **Present them with a single, identifiable victim who they can help**: people are more motivated to help if they can feel a personal connection with the victim.

2. **Appeal to their emotions**: heightened emotional responses encourage altruistic behaviour.

3. **Instill a sense of responsibility to help, and an understanding that doing so is not futile.**

In part 2 I’ll talk about how we might encourage others to help more by challenging norms of self-interest, communicating more openly about helping others, and providing some small nudges.

Your three conclusions makes me think of an idea that I would like to apply since a long time.

--------------------------------------

* * *

Paramedics have to make life or death decisions in the blink of an eye every day. Novices tend to follow simple rules in these situations, which work well up to a point. But with experience paramedics begin to make better, faster decisions, without any conscious awareness of the rules they are following. These decisions appear to be based on “gut feeling”: knowing what to do without knowing how you know.[^1]

Along a similar vein, chess grandmasters are able to identify and decide on the best moves incredibly rapidly, moves which mediocre players may not even spot at all.[^2] But this ability to make astoundingly accurate judgements in the blink of an eye isn’t limited to experts. We all do it every day: when we judge what someone else is feeling from their facial expressions, or catch a ball without doing any complex physics calculation.[^3]

<a href='http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/shutterstock_73070908.jpg'><img alt="Formula" class="image large" src="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/shutterstock_73070908.jpg" /></a>

##How are these triumphs of intuition possible? 

The environments in which chess players and paramedics make their decisions are very different, but share two key similarities. First, they are both fairly *regular*: there are identifiable cues and patterns of actions leading to outcomes. From certain moves or patterns of moves in chess you can predict fairly reliably what the response will be. For most casualties there are known methods of treatment.  Second, both provide fairly good and fast *feedback*. A chess player will find out pretty quickly whether his move was a good one or not; a paramedic can tell whether their treatment has worked by looking at the patient’s response. 

When there is *sufficient regularity* and *good feedback*, a person can begin to recognise patterns in the environment through prolonged experience and practice. The chess player slowly begins to recognise patterns of moves that work, the paramedic recognises courses of action fit for a unique case based on past experience of similar cases. This ability to recognise patterns becomes automated and subconscious, explaining the phenomenon of “knowing without knowing how you know”.[^4] 

What about the fast and subconscious judgements we make on a daily basis? Catching a ball might not seem all that extraordinary, but consider the following observation made by Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene:

*“When a man throws a ball high in the air and catches it again, he behaves as if he had solved a set of differential equations in predicting the trajectory of the ball. He may neither know nor care what a differential equation is, but this does not affect his skill with the ball.”*

It doesn’t seem all that plausible that this is what a four year old child does when a ball is thrown at him, especially when we consider what’s involved. In theory, the path a ball takes when thrown is a parabola: so estimating this would require the brain to estimate the ball’s initial distance, velocity, and projection angle - plus the speed and direction of the wind at each point in order to take into account air resistance and spin. All within a few seconds. If people could actually do this, we’d also expect them to be good at predicting where a ball will strike the ground when thrown. But they’re not.

##Simple rules of thumb

Is there an alternative explanation? Experimental studies show that in fact what’s going on here is the use of several different *rules of thumb*, one of which is the *gaze heuristic*: fix your gaze on the ball, start running, and adjust your running speed so that the angle of gaze remains constant. By subconsciously using this rule, people are able to catch balls without measuring distances, angles or air resistance: in fact, without really thinking at all.[^5]

The use of simple *rules of thumb* or *heuristics* explain many of the quick decisions and judgements we’re able to make in everyday life. We infer people’s emotions and preferences from their facial expressions using rules of thumb like “people who smile a lot are happy”, and “the chocolate bar she’s staring at is the one she wants.” 

So it appears that in some situations, intuitive judgements can help people to make good decisions and save a great deal of time. “Going with your gut” can save lives if you’re an experienced paramedic and don’t have the time for detailed and deliberative reasoning. This seems to directly contradict earlier results: that [our intuitions can’t be trusted](http://80000hours.org/blog/109-should-we-stop-interviewing-people), and where expert intuitions were repeatedly [outdone by a simple formula](http://80000hours.org/blog/117-a-formula-for-the-perfect-job). 

##When can you trust your gut?

Let’s first take a step back. I’ve been talking a lot about *“gut feelings”* and *“intuitions”*. But what are we really referring to here? Gerd Gigerenzer, a German psychologist who has spent a large amount of his career studying “gut feelings”, puts it more eloquently than I could:

*”I use the terms gut feeling, intuition, or hunch interchangeably, to refer to a judgement that appears quickly in consciousness, whose underlying reasons we are not fully aware of, and is strong enough to act upon.”* [^5]

These judgements seem to arise in one of two ways. In the case of expert judgement, they develop as a result of prolonged practice and experience. Everyday intuitive judgements, on the other hand, arise through the application of rules of thumb appropriate for the environment. [^4]

In order to judge whether an intuition is trustworthy, we need to consider both the environment in which the judgement is being made, and the person making the judgement.

On the whole, we’d expect intuitive judgements to be trustworthy when:

1. The environment  is **sufficiently regular** that there are patterns which can be recognised through experience.

2. The person making the judgement has **enough experience** in the environment to recognise these patterns.

3. There’s enough **quick, accurate feedback**, that a person can learn from mistakes through experience.

Next time you or someone else have a “gut feeling” about something, it’s worth using these points as a checklist to help decide whether you should go with it or not.

What does this mean for career choice - should you trust your gut, or not? Find out in part 4...

National wage and employment surveys, such as the UK [Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ashe/annual-survey-of-hours-and-earnings/ashe-results-2011/ashe-statistical-bulletin-2011.html) or the US Occupational Employment Statistics [database](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm) provide good places to start. However, typical salary is an imperfect measure of career earnings. This post discusses five ways in which the national surveys can mislead at first glance, particularly for the most financially rewarding areas, in hopes of providing some protection to the casual explorer and explaining how in-depth analysis can help.

##High-wage fields in the United Kingdom

For the moment, most of the membership of 80,000 hours is based in the UK, so I will use the 2011 ASHE statistics to set the stage. One can download the data [here](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ashe/annual-survey-of-hours-and-earnings/ashe-results-2011/ashe-statistical-bulletin-2011.html), view a table ranking UK occupations by median income in ASHE [here](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2067258/Best-paid-jobs-2011-Tables-official-figures-UK-salaries.html), or just consider these high-income occupations (the top 4, followed by a selection of others near the top): 

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td class="c3"><p class="c4"><span>Profession</span></p></td><td class="c5"><p class="c4"><span>Median salary (&pound;)</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class="c3"><p class="c4"><span>Directors and chief executives of major organizations</span></p></td><td class="c5"><p class="c4"><span>112,157</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class="c3"><p class="c4"><span>Corporate managers and senior officials</span></p></td><td class="c5"><p class="c4"><span>77,679</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class="c3"><p class="c4"><span>Aircraft pilots and flight engineers</span></p></td><td class="c5"><p class="c4"><span>71,555</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class="c3"><p class="c4"><span>Medical professionals</span></p></td><td class="c5"><p class="c4"><span>69,952</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class="c3"><p class="c4"><span>Brokers (finance and insurance);</span></p></td><td class="c5"><p class="c4"><span>54,924</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class="c3"><p class="c4"><span>Financial managers and chartered secretaries</span></p></td><td class="c5"><p class="c4"><span>53,944</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class="c3"><p class="c4"><span>Health professionals</span></p></td><td class="c5"><p class="c4"><span>48,775</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class="c3"><p class="c4"><span>Solicitors and lawyers, judges and coroners</span></p></td><td class="c5"><p class="c4"><span>44,552</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class="c3"><p class="c4"><span>Electronics engineer</span></p></td><td class="c5"><p class="c4"><span>43,772</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class="c3"><p class="c4"><span>Mechanical engineer</span></p></td><td class="c5"><p class="c4"><span>39,142</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class="c3"><p class="c4"><span>Corporate managers</span></p></td><td class="c5"><p class="c4"><span>38,091</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class="c3"><p class="c4"><span>Software professionals</span></p></td><td class="c5"><p class="c4"><span>36,634</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class="c3"><p class="c4"><span>Architect</span></p></td><td class="c5"><p class="c4"><span>36,375</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class="c3"><p class="c4"><span>Pharmacists/pharmacologists</span></p></td><td class="c5"><p class="c4"><span>36,211</span></p></td></tr><tr><td class="c3"><p class="c4"><span>Management accountants</span></p></td><td class="c5"><p class="c4"><span>35,851</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

The presence of management and leadership roles is unsurprising: these are senior positions by definition. Other occupations are disproportionately ones that require an uncommon, specialized skill or advanced education. Unfortunately, several of these fields exemplify particular limitations of the data.

##Non-wage compensation

The ASHE survey considers only wages and certain cash bonuses. For example, it leaves out self-employment, partnership income, business ownership, restricted stock, and stock options. This is particularly pernicious, since so many of the most lucrative careers make heavy use of these compensation methods.

Professional services firms in law, accounting, and management consulting are typically organized as partnerships, with partners receiving the profits of the firm (in a fashion reflecting their labor contributions similar to ordinary wages, save for fluctuating more with firm outcomes). In [this survey](http://www.thelawyer.com/1009501.article) of law profits for 200 of the largest British law firms, overall profit margins tend to be in the 20-40% range, making law significantly more attractive than the ASHE data would suggest.

In finance, the immense incomes of hedge fund and private equity managers have primarily taken the form of [carried interest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carried_interest), treated as return on investment in their funds rather than as a wage. At investment banks in the City of London and Wall Street restricted stock and stock options play a much larger role in compensation for non-executive employees than in most other industries (although of course this does play a substantial role for senior executives and employees in startup-rich industries).

Also worth mentioning is the role of oversize pensions in some areas, particularly in government, where increasing pensions is less controversial than raising salaries.

##Career length: education, experience and exit options

ASHE statistics reflect the incomes of those who are currently working in an occupation, but not income associated with any pre-requisite steps.

For some of the high-salary categories taking pre-requisites into account makes a large difference: it is rare to become a “director or chief executive of a major organization” without paying one’s dues for years in more junior positions, save perhaps through successful early [entrepreneurship](http://80000hours.org/blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers). A British physician must first complete a long degree, requiring [5 or 6 years](http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/courses/medicine/medicine_course.html) as a first course, before taking training positions with the NHS. The additional years of schooling mean substantial foregone earnings, and the loss of any chance for investment or social returns on the earnings. In the U.S., where a 4 year medical degree must be preceded by another (usually 4-year) degree, this is an even larger penalty.

On the other side, some fields normally offer short careers. In the extreme, models or athletes may be lucky to have a 3 year career. More importantly, while a physician will usually remain a physician throughout her career, lucrative jobs in investment banking and management consulting often come with “up or out” career paths. Either one is promoted "up," with incomes growing exponentially, as one can see in these links for [banks](http://www.careers-in-finance.com/ibsal.htm) and [consultancies](http://www.careers-in-business.com/consulting/mcsal.htm), or one is fired "out" and must seek work at a lesser firm or leave the industry. Since most employees will not be around for very long, one must take into account one's "exit options" in deciding whether to enter.

##Matched wages and expenses

For a business, the key measure is not revenue earned, but the profit after costs are deducted. Similarly, some jobs carry additional costs that substantially reduce their expected financial rewards. Some of these costs are fairly direct, e.g. professional school tuition, business attire, and costs of expensive socializing with work colleagues. Tuition costs can be severe, but are often highly subsidized by government.

Lucrative positions also often require living in relatively expensive cities, with higher housing prices and cost-of-living. The global financial industry is disproportionately concentrated in the City of London and downtown Manhattan in New York City, areas with extremely high real estate prices. Long hours and congestion necessitate renting or purchasing property near work as the opportunity costs of commuting are driven to very high levels. Technology workers and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley face similarly high real estate costs. These locations also tend to have high state and local tax rates, as governments exploit immobile concentrations of wealth: in the U.S. California (Silicon Valley and Hollywood) and New York have the [highest state taxes](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123940286075109617.html), with New York City exacting additional income tax to capture Wall Street wealth.

##Heterogenous categories

Median figures for broad occupational classifications can conceal enormous sub-category variation. In previous posts I discussed how uncommon but extreme impacts can be important in assessing the expected impact of [entrepreneurship](http://80000hours.org/blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers) and [politics](http://80000hours.org/blog/22-how-hard-is-it-to-become-prime-minister-of-the-united-kingdom), but similar considerations also apply in other fields, particularly finance.

Some statistical categories include quite different career tracks, e.g. a “financial workers” category that included both stockbrokers and investment bankers. These jobs require very different skills, and one knows which one is entering in advance. Different medical medicine different subspecialties can bring different earnings, and odds of getting a chosen specialty can vary with medical school and performance (which can be predicted with GPA and MCAT score in the US, similar stuff for UK).

##Industry risk

Over time industries rise and fall. Since 1970, the financial industry (construed broadly) has greatly [increased its share](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financialization) of the US and UK economies, but this process has reversed itself before: it took 60 years from the start of the Great Depression for finance as a share of GDP to recover. Investment banking compensation fluctuates wildly with the movement of the economy and the stock market: some [studies](http://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/workshops/AppliedEcon/docs/OyerPaperInvestmentBankerOct11Aut06AEW.pdf) have claimed that boom or bust on Wall Street affects the expected earnings of elite business school graduates by millions of dollars,  reducing both the number and compensation of investment banking jobs available.

While predictable short term fluctuations can be dealt with tactically (e.g. delaying entrance to business school in a crash year), and medium-term fluctuations can be averaged over (using historical data) when evaluating the expected value of undertaking career, large shifts in the economy can devalue (or revalue) a sector and are hard to precisely predict. For such sectoral shifts, one can simply note that one is paying attention to a field because the combination of lasting and temporary factors has made it lucrative, and [regress towards the mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean) across sectors when looking into the distant future.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier></dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2012-02-25 09:14:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>208</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Chris Smith</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>christohper.smith@keble.ox.ac.uk</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-02-26 12:39:33</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Love this Carl, great to see thought put in to career length - as I think our current advice, especially with respect to ibanking and consulting, fails to take much account of career length (see this: <a href="http://epicureandealmaker.blogspot.com/2012/02/standard-model.html" rel="nofollow">http://epicureandealmaker.blog...</a> on banking).

That said though, it would be interesting to see what those who left careers as bankers and consultants went on to do. Consultancies make much of their exit options in their recruitment literature, and if McKinsey's exit record is anything like matched at other top 10/15 firms then I think it remains a very high career compensation path, even for those who don't stay in consulting itself. Similarly, both consultants and bankers often go on to private equity houses, which have the potential to be the fastest way to make money short of creating another facebook or running a successful multi-billion dollar hedge fund. This question of longer term earnings would be complicated by all those who leave intense City/Wall Street jobs and realise that they're not looking for money after all.

For those staying at consulting firms, I guess we'd want to look at career, rather than annual earnings, and career earnings would be affected significantly by the chances of making the partnership, the average tenure, the revenue per equity partner and all sorts of things.

However, the more lucrative areas like successful hedge fund and private equity roles are scarcer, and the typical options like corporate finance and industrial management involve reduced compensation (with better lifestyle) relative to remaining on track. Certainly, elite MBAs who do investment banking make more than such MBAs in other fields.

The far right tail of finance comes from setting up one's own funds, mostly, (there are more self-made finance billionaires in the US than technology ones, generally through this route). This bumps up earnings significantly, but not radically. 

My best impression now is that for consulting and finance the exit options are on average less lucrative, even controlling for people who go off to nonprofits or academia or government   Harvard. However, the exit options are still lucrative positions (better, often much better, than one would find as a non-entrepreneur engineer, say), and the stint in consulting or investment banking increases one's marketability for them via signaling/credentialism and networking (even after accounting for the selection bias that places like McKinsey and Goldman Sachs are more selective than most MBA employers).

There are ways of estimating whole-career earnings for these fields: we've looked at attrition rates, tax records (which include partnership figures and raw numbers), school alumni surveys, and firm filings and other records.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Why don't people help others more? - part 2</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/119-why-don-t-people-help-others-more-part-2</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[In [part 1](http://80000hours.org/blog/118-why-don-t-people-help-others-more-part-1), I talked about some ways in which we might motivate people to be more altruistic. Providing a personal connection with the victim and appealing to a someone’s emotional responses seem to help. So too can instilling a sense of responsibility to help others, and an understanding that doing so is not futile.

All these observations are incrdibly valuable. But I think there’s more to understanding why people don’t help others more, despite the fact they may believe in doing so in principle. A huge factor here is the behaviour of others. Most people appear to have a strong tendency not to want to help more than the other people around them.

##What's Fair In Help?

<a href="http://naturalrhythms.org/2.0/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/woman_man_moneyiStock_000003224362XSmall.jpg"><img alt="Formula" class="image large" src="http://naturalrhythms.org/2.0/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/woman_man_moneyiStock_000003224362XSmall.jpg" /></a>
*If you were asked to share this money with a stranger, how much would you give them?*

It's clear that **people value fairness, even to their own detriment**. In a game called "the Ultimatum Game", one participant is given a sum of money by the researcher, say $10, and told they can split this money with an anonymous second player in any proportion they choose -- give them $10, give them $7, give them $5, give them nothing, everything is fair game. The catch is, however, the second player, after hearing of the split anonymously, gets to vote to accept it or reject it. Should the split be accepted, both players walk away with the agreed amount. But should the split be rejected, both players walk away with nothing.

**A Fair Split**

The economist, expecting ideally rational and perfectly self-interested players, predicts that the second player would accept any split that gets them money, since anything is better than nothing. And the first player, understanding this, would naturally offer $1 and keep $9 for himself. At no point are identities revealed, so reputation and retribution are no issue.

But the results turn out to be quite different -- the vast majority offer an equal split. Yet, when an offer comes around that offers $2 or less, it is almost always rejected, even though $2 is better than nothing.[^1]  And this effect persists even when played for thousands of dollars and persists across nearly all cultures.

**Splitting and Anchoring in Charity**

This sense of fairness persists into helping as well -- people generally have a strong tendency not to want to help more than the other people around them, and if they find themselves the only ones helping on a frequent basis, they start to feel a "sucker". On the flipside, if others are doing more, they will follow suit.[^2],[^3],[^4]

Those told the average donation to a charity nearly always tend to give that amount, even if the average told to them is a lie, having secretly been increased or decreased. And it can be replicated even without lying -- those told about an above average gift were far more likely to donate more, even attempting to match that gift.[^5],[^6]  Overall, we tend to match the behavior of our reference class -- those people we identify with -- and this includes how much we help. We donate more when we believe others are donating more, and donate less when we believe others are doing so.
 
##Challenging the Self-Interest Norm


But there's a way to break this cycle of futility, responsibility, and fairness -- challenge the norm by openly communicating about helping others. While many religious and secular values insist that the best giving is anonymous giving, this turns out to not always be the case. While there may be other reasons to give anonymously, don't forget the benefits of giving openly -- being open about helping inspires others to help, and can help challenge the norms of the culture.

Indeed, many organizations now exist to help challenge the norms of donations and try to create a culture where they give more. [Giving What We Can](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) is a community of 230 people ([including me!](http://www.greatplay.net/essays/joining-givingwhatwecan)) who have all pledged to donate at least 10% of their income to organizations working on ending extreme poverty, and submit statements proving so. [Bolder Giving](http://boldergiving.org/stories.php) has a bunch of inspiring stories of over 100 people who all give at least 20% of their income, with a dozen giving over 90%! And these aren't all rich people, some of them are even ordinary students.

**Who's Willing to Be Altruistic?**

While people are not saints, experiments have shown that people tend to grossly overestimate how self-interested other people are -- for one example, people estimated that males would overwhelmingly favor a piece of legislation to "slash research funding to a disease that affects only women", even while -- being male -- they themselves do not support such legislation.[^7]

This also manifests itself in an expectation that people be "self-interested" in their philanthropic cause -- suggesting much stronger support for volunteers in Students Against Drunk Driving who themselves knew people killed in drunk driving accidents versus those people who had no such personal experiences but just thought it to be "a very important cause".[^8]

Alex de Tocqueville, echoing the early economists who expected $9/$1 splits in the Ultimatum Game, wrote in 1835 that "Americans enjoy explaining almost every act of their lives on the principle of self-interest".[^9]  But this isn't always the case, and in challenging the norm, people make it more acceptable to be altruistic. It's not just "goody two-shoes", and it's praiseworthy to be "too charitable".
 
##A Bit of a Nudge

A somewhat pressing problem in getting people to help was in organ donation -- surely no one was inconvenienced by having their organs donated after they had died. Yet, why would people not sign up?  And how could we get more people to sign up?

In Germany, only 12% of the population are registered organ donors. In nearby Austria, that number is 99.98%. Are people in Austria just less worried about what will happen to them after they die, or just that more altruistic? It turns out the answer is far more simple -- in Germany you must put yourself on the register to become a potential donor (opt-in), whereas in Austria you are a potential donor unless you object (opt-out). While people may be, for right or for wrong, worried about the fate of their body after it is dead, they appear less likely to express these reservations in opt-out systems.[^10]

While Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein argue in their book [Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wellness, and Happiness](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300122233) that we sometimes suck at making decisions in our own interest and all could do better with more favorable "defaults", such defaults are also pressing in helping people.

While opt-out organ donation is a huge deal, there's another similar idea -- opt-out philanthropy. Back before 2008 when the investment bank Bear Stearns still existed, Bear Stearns listed their guiding principle as philanthropy as fostering good citizenship and well-rounded individuals. To this effect, [they required the top 1000 most highest paid employees to donate 4% of their salary and bonuses to non-profits](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E4DB1530F931A25752C1A9619C8B63&pagewanted=all), and prove it with their tax returns. This resulted in more than $45 million in donations during 2006. Many employees described the requirement as "getting themselves to do what they wanted to do anyway".
 
##Conclusions

So, according to what we’ve seen here and in part 1, what could we do to get other people to help more, besides moralize? Well, we have five key take-aways:

1. Present these people with a **single and highly identifiable victim** that they can help
2. **Nudge** them with a default of opt-out philanthropy
3. **Be more open** about our willingness to be altruistic and **encourage** other people to help
4. Make sure people **understand the average level of helping** around them, and
5. Instill a **responsibility** to help and an understanding that doing so is **not futile**.

Hopefully, with these tips and more, helping people more can become just one of those things we do.

How much good should one expect to do in a political career aimed at Parliament or Prime Ministership in the United Kingdom? A number of members of 80,000 hours suspect that they have above-average suitability for politics, but want to compare the field against [research](http://80000hours.org/blog/5-high-impact-science) or [entrepreneurship](http://80000hours.org/blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers). To do that we need to think about the power of elected officials to sway policy in office, the value of different policies, and the probability that a political career will reach various levels of success. This post will take a stab at the last question, using data from Parliament and the educational system.

With a strong academic background, interest in politics, and social skill those chances may be surprisingly good, as much as 1 in 3 for becoming an MP, and 1 in 300 for PM. Let's take a first pass at our [Fermi calculation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem) and see how. 

**People per Parliamentarian**

As of mid-2010, there were an estimated [62,260,000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) people in the United Kingdom, and [650](http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/state-of-the-parties/) MPs in the House of Commons.  As of this [BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8675705.stm) there were 23 members of the Cabinet, including the Prime Minister.  Thus if we knew nothing further about a randomly selected person in the United Kingdom, we would assign a chance of about 1 in 96 thousand that she was an MP, 1 in 2.7 million for Cabinet, and 1 in 62 million for PM.

However, the average time in office of an MP is much less than the typical British life expectancy, so that a Parliamentary study found [906 living people](http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN05324) who have formerly served as Members in the House of Commons, despite the average age of current members being [50](http://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-commons-faqs/members-faq-page2/). When we add the (larger) group of currently living people who will go on to serve in the future, it seems safe to estimate at least 3100 current, former, and future MPs, giving odds of 1 in 20,000 that a randomly selected Briton falls into that class.

**Education predicts election**

The [Sutton Trust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_Trust) sponsors research on the relationship between education and success in the United Kingdom, and conducted a helpful [study](http://www.suttontrust.com/research/the-educational-backgrounds-of-mps/) of the educational backgrounds of MPs elected to the Commons in 2010, with educational background data on 608 out of the 650.

For newly elected MPs with data, 94% were university graduates, 69% graduated from a research university that was part of the [Russell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Group) Group or [1994](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Group#Overview) Group, and fully 28% graduated from Oxford or Cambridge. The Trust lists MP totals for leading universities with Oxford (102), Cambridge (58), LSE (25), Edinburgh (15), Manchester (14), and Durham (12).

Oxford handed out [3,092](http://tinyurl.com/7kdbdza) undergraduate degrees in 2010, whereas HESA [statistics](http://www.hesa.ac.uk/content/view/1897/239/) indicate that 311,465 UK citizens received first undergraduate degrees in 2010-2011. In contrast, there have been between 650,000 and a little more than 1 million births each year in the United Kingdom over the last [50 years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom#Population), with numbers around 750,000 when current undergraduate students were born.

We could draw a rough first estimate (neglecting childhood deaths, the increasing rate of university attendance, etc) of the chance that a randomly selected Oxford graduate will at some point be elected to Parliament are in the vicinity of 1 in 500, i.e. that each year there about 6 Oxonians who will serve.

**To succeed, first show up**

The great majority of Oxford students never go on to run for elected government office. They become doctors, financiers, consultants, academics, attorneys, and so forth. The fact that they fail to attain a goal they did not pursue is unsurprising, and so to estimate the difficulty of attaining office it would be best if we could focus on some subgroups that were disproportionately prone to launching political careers. Membership in such a group would predict political interest and some degree of political skill (since those with political savvy would tend to select into such a group).

At Oxford, there is one course especially known for attracting those interested in politics (which cannot be studied on its own), namely the Philosophy, Politics, and Economics [PPE](http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/courses/philosophy_politics_and_economics/philosophy_politic_4.html), with an intake of 239 students. If all of these graduate, they would make up just under 8% of Oxford undergraduate degree holders. Yet there were some 35 grads serving in the 2010 House of Commons according to this BBC [article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11136511), more than a third of the Oxford representation in the commons. Thus, the chance of a randomly selected PPE graduate eventually being elected would seem to be some 4 times as great as for a random Oxford graduate, perhaps 1 in 125.

Since 14% of Oxford undergrads are [international](http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/international_students/index.html) (and thus ineligible for Parliament unless they immigrate), the number could be further adjusted to ~1 in 108, assuming that international representation is at least as high in PPE as elsewhere. In fact, since PPE is a magnet for the children of foreign elites, the percentage is likely higher (I have not yet received a reply from the PPE program on the true figure). 

Of course, not all PPE graduates are interested in a career in politics: many go into finance, academia (including philosophy, economics, or other non-politics oriented academia), NGOs, even school teaching or writing. Those who are interested in government may enter (and remain in) the civil service, political journalism, political science, or supporting roles (lobbyists, consultants, etc) without willingness to pursue elected office. Some finer discrimination is needed to get a grip on the odds for those who actively pursue politics. Some may find the effects of a political career on quality of life unacceptable. Filtering to those focused on elective office might improve the odds by a factor of 3, or 10. But how can we make a finer discrimination? One natural route is to look at those who seek and obtain elected office at Oxford.

**Oxford Unions and their president-alumni**

Oxford hosts two storied Unions, the [Oxford University Student Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University_Student_Union), a student government, and the Oxford Union, a major debating society. My understanding, by way of talking with Oxonians, is that the leadership of the OUSU has historically tended to supply candidates to the left in Britain, while the OU has tended to supply candidates to the right. This is well known, and elections are hotly contested, despite restrictive campaign rules (which elicit clever attempts to campaign without being caught, perhaps a good model of the intrigue of nonacademic politics). Further, the OUSU presidency is a full time job for a year, indicating a strong commitment to politics.

What happens to past presidents? I sampled from each organization's alumni, from the same period, to get a sense. The OUSU website provides a list of past presidents, starting in [1974](http://www.ousu.org/about/past-sabbatical-officers-1/). For the 1974 president and the next 10 names (covering 1974-1985, due to a blank in the list) I attempted to discern their career track using Google Search. I was wholly unable to track 2 presidents (implying no major positions in public life), 2 were ambiguously identified as sucessfully pursuing non-politics careers (economics and business), 1 pursued journalism without clear political intentions, 1 was identified as succeeding in business, and 5 pursued politics at some point.

Of those five, 2 reached senior positions in local government, heading councils, 2 had long tenures as Members of Parliament, and one held some important unelected positions while building businesses using his connections, including an investment bank:

1. Gareth Daniel [heads the Brent Council](http://www.brent.gov.uk/home.nsf/Files/LBBA-74/$FILE/Gareth%20Daniel.pdf), which manages a 1 billion pound budget and covers the 7th largest borough in the UK, a position he reached through entry into local civil service soon after graduation.
2. David Parsons heads the Leicestershire Council which [spends 400 million pounds annually]( http://www.leics.gov.uk/final_signed_statement_of_accounts_2010-11.pdf)
3. [Andrew Elliott](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/andrew-elliott/6/178/435) entered business as a corporate executive and consultant both for McKinsey and his own consulting firm, with no sign of ever pursuing politics after graduation.
4. No sign of David Tregiles appeared in a Google Search.
5. [Peter Batey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Batey) went to work at an investment bank for 3 years and then acted as political private secretary to Prime Minister Heath for 4 years, before entering into business in China; he runs a small [investment bank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermilion_Partners_Ltd) there.
6. [Lesley Riddoch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesley_Riddoch) went immediately into journalism, with 10 years with her own BBC radio shows,  in addition to magazines and some TV shows.
7. I did not clearly identify Alan Hughes. 
8. [John Grogan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Grogan_%28UK_politician%29) held positions with city councils, running a private conference business, and working for the Labor party while repeatedly running for elected office until he succeeded in 1997, 15 years after his OUSU tenure, when he was elected a Member of Parliament from 1997-2010 for Labor.
9. I was unable to clearly identify Pat Wall, although he may have [become](http://www.metapack.com/index.php/company/people/106) a McKinsey consultant, logistics executive, and entrepreneur.
10. I was unable to track down James Dickinson.
11. [Matthew Taylor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Taylor,_Baron_Taylor_of_Goss_Moor
86), after graduating in PPE, went to work for an MP. That MP died, with Taylor taking his seat  in 1987, two years after his OUSU tenure, and remaining an MP until 2010, when he moved to the House of Lords.  

For the Oxford Union, I started with the same year as for the OUSU, and worked my way down the [list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_of_the_Oxford_Union) until I had an equal number of names, excluding non-British citizens (the Pakistan PM [Benazir Bhutto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benazir_Bhutto), the South African [Simon Walker](http://blogs.iod.com/2011/10/03/simon-walker-new-director-general/#.Tz8Q7bFmJRM) who advised the PM for 2 years, and Robert Scoble, a successful Australian diplomat until his career was [derailed](http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/26/1079939852092.html) by pedophilia). I was unable to find out what happened to 2, 3 seemed to have become successful lawyers or businesspeople without visible political activity, 1 became an author and political journalist, and 5 pursued politics. Of those pursuing politics, 2 were defeated and went on to hold lesser positions, 2 reached Parliament and Cabinet, and one reached the House of Lords through inheritance: 

1. Michael Soole, a successful London [lawyer](http://www.chambersandpartners.com/uk-bar/Firms/10376-45560/230417).
2. I was unable to locate Robert McDonagh.
3. [Victor van Amerongen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_van_Amerongen) went to work at the BBC and became a wealthy advertising entrepreneur without apparent further political entanglement.
4. [David Soskin](http://www.netprofitbook.com/author) went to Harvard Business school and seems to have successfully focused on business and entrepreneurship 
5. The fate of Andrew Bell eluded me.
6. [Colin Moynihan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Moynihan) was a famous coxswain (winning an Olympic Gold), in 1981 went to work for an MP, was elected himself in 1983, and served until 1992, including as Minister of Sport.
7. [Richard Norton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Norton,_8th_Baron_Grantley), heir to a baronial title, worked for the Conservative research wing, as an advisor on trade and energy, and as a local councillor, in addition serving for a time in the House of Lords. 
8. [Victoria Schofield](http://www.victoriaschofield.com/) has been an author, primarily writing about South Asia including her friend Benazir Bhutto.
9. [Damien Green](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Green) spent 15 years mostly working in news, but also in the Conservative party, losing in his first run for office, but being elected in 1997 and remaining in office to the present day, as well as becoming Minister of Immigration in 2010.
10. [Nicholas O’Shaugnessy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_O%27Shaughnessy) became a professor of communications, and ran for Parliament but was defeated.
11. [Daniel Moylan](http://www.danielmoylan.com/?page_id=51) ran for Parliament after working in the civil service and starting investment banking, but was defeated and went on to pursue financial and consulting/training business as well as serving on a council.

If we assume that half of the untraceable individuals attempted to pursue public office but failed, and that most of those without visible electoral efforts were focused on their business, academic, or media interests, we see a sizable fraction of those at this high level of ability and connections are able to reach office if they choose, perhaps 1 in 3. The expectation for another Oxford student with a strong political focus, but less demonstrated political savvy would be less, but as the earlier sections suggested, not vanishingly so.

**From MP to PM**

Since reaching Cabinet or 10 Downing Street is even more competitive than election as an MP (the contenders have mostly met the latter challenge already), we would expect the same predictors of success run even stronger. For instance, Oxbridge graduates make up 20% of Labor MPs and 38% of Conservative MPs, but [made up](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/may/12/new-cabinet-whos-who-list) 32% of Gordon Brown's last Cabinet, and 69% of the recent coalition Cabinet. In other words, the Oxbridge advantage is more than one and a half times as great at this level (perhaps also reflecting in part the importance of education and intelligence in policymaking functions of Cabinet).

At the level of Prime Minister, 9 of the last 13 Prime Ministers since 1940 have been Oxford graduates, plus one from Edinburgh, Winston Churchill (military academy), John Major (correspondence course in banking), and Jim Callaghan (military background, rose via working-class unions in the Labour party). Looking back through the rest of the 20th century, there were 3 Prime Ministers who studied at Cambridge, 1 more at Oxford, 1 at Mason Science College, and 3 without university education. However, some of those without university education would likely have acquired it in the modern age, e.g. Lloyd George could 'article' or apprentice as a lawyer without attending law school as would be required today. At that time, completion of high school signaled similar relative status to a university education today. 

The Oxford:Cambridge ratio is consistent with other data, such as the ratios of MPs from the two schools. As university education becomes ubiquitous in Parliament, it seems reasonable to project these trends forward for a few decades and predict that between one and two thirds of Prime Ministers will be derived from Oxbridge over that window, although [regression toward the mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean) indicates that we should expect a lower Oxford share. With 21 Prime Ministers since 1901, Prime Ministerial tenure seems to be between half and a third of Commons tenure, giving a further boost to the odds of (at least for a time) reaching that office. Given a randomly selected former OU or OUSU president (who is already an MP), we might project as much as 1 in 100 chance of at some point serving as Prime Minister. For such a student still at Oxford, an "outside view" estimate could plausibly assign between 1 in 300 and 1 in 500 probability to eventual PM status.

**What to make of political long-shots?**

These estimates, for those with the relevant indicators, are vastly higher than the general prior for high political office, but they remain long-shots in any given case, far more so for higher offices. There is a special altruistic [case](http://80000hours.org/blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers) for such risky prospects if they have high expected value in some currency that can buy important goods without severe [diminishing returns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns), as the best interventions run out of [room-for-more-funding](http://givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/scalability) and one must shift to less promising ones. 

However, for higher-end political offices such as Prime Minister scales are so large that running out of "room-for-more political influence" is a real risk, particularly if one thinks that the most important causes today have only modest resources dedicated to them. To make a case for politics over alternatives one would need to explain just how political influence should be applied, and how scalable those opportunities are. But these are questions for another day.

These seem to be far more difficult to quantify than the probabilities of members of certain populations getting elected. I look forward to seeing what you have to write on these points.

Suppose your goal is to shift the political debate. Some of the most politically influential people in history never got anywhere near political office. Marx and his impoverished family come to mind. 

It seems like Lenin or George Washington obviously were very influential because they started a regime or government. But overall, are the most politically influential people in history actually the politicians? My guess would have to be no and that this title belongs to various intellectuals and writers, although exactly which kinds would be an interesting question--one might debate the relative merits of empirical research, political theory and popular writing. Politicians in contrast seem usually like the surface layer of a political ocean that is mostly formed by abstract ideas.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>807</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>David Watts</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>iwishicouldbelike@googlemail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-01-06 00:49:49</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Bobby Mcdonagh is an Irish diplomat, ]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1341</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Chris Hennick</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>seahen123@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/chris-hennick</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-09-27 10:47:57</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This article seems prone to the correlational fallacy.

The full significance of this third way is commonly overlooked.

It is, of course, widely appreciated that certain academic contributions lay the theoretical or empirical foundations for further work. One reason why a great scientist such as Einstein is celebrated is that his discoveries have enabled thousands of other scientists to tackle problems that they could not have solved without relativity theory.

Yet even this deep and beautiful theory is, in one sense, very narrow. While relativity is of great help in cosmology and some other parts of physics, it is of little use to a geneticist, a palaeontologist, or a neuroscientist. General relativity theory is therefore a significant but not a vast contribution to the scientific enterprise as a whole.

Some findings have wider applicability. The scientific method itself — the idea of creating hypotheses and subjecting them to stringent empirical tests — is one such. Many of the basic results in statistics also have very wide applicability. And some scientific instruments, such as the thermometer, the microscope, and the computer, have proved enormously useful over a wide range of domains. Institutional innovations — such as the peer‐reviewed journal — should also be counted.

Those who seek the advancement of human knowledge should focus more on these kinds of indirect contribution. A “superficial” contribution that facilitates work across a
wide range of domains can be worth much more than a relatively “profound” contribution limited to one narrow field, just as a lake can contain a lot more water than a well, even if the well is deeper.

No contribution would be more generally applicable than one that improves the performance of the human brain. Much more effort ought to be devoted to the development of techniques for cognitive enhancement, be they drugs to improve concentration, mental energy, and memory, or nutritional enrichments of infant formulato optimize brain development. Society invests vast resources in education in an attempt to improve students’ cognitive abilities. Why does it spend so little on studying the biology of maximizing the performance of the human nervous system?

<a href="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/1867897faj0vpjpg/original.jpg"><img alt="Formula" class="image large" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/1867897faj0vpjpg/original.jpg" /></a>
Imagine a researcher invented an inexpensive drug which was completely safe and which improved all‐round cognitive performance by just 1%. The gain would hardly be noticeable in a single individual. But if the 10 million scientists in the world all benefited from the drug the inventor would increase the rate of scientific progress by at least the same amount as adding 100,000 new scientists. (In fact, there's good reason to think the effect would be much greater.) Each year the invention would amount to an indirect contribution equal to more than 100,000 times what the average scientist contributes. Even an Einstein or a Darwin at the peak of their powers could not make such a great impact. Meanwhile others too could benefit from being able to think better, including engineers, school children, accountants, and politicians.

This example illustrates the enormous potential of improving human cognition by even a tiny amount. Those who are serious about seeking the advancement of human knowledge and understanding need to crunch the numbers. Better academic institutions, methodologies, instrumentation, and especially cognitive enhancement are the fast tracks to scientific progress.

However, we can still make significant steps toward improving the cognitive capabilities of the species as a whole.  For instance, improving hygeine in Africa would be a tremendously helpful step.  Africa suffers from near-universal hookworm infestation.  Hookworm causes PERMANENT IQ loss in those infected as children, and there is unlikely to be a single child in Africa who does not contract hookworm while growing up.  Malaria has less significant, but similar, effects, and many African children spend not-insignificant portions of their childhood sick or recovering from malaria.  Hookworm used to be a problem in the southern US, but improvements in hygiene have mostly eliminated it as a serious problem, so we do know how to do it.

If you do what most people
do, you’ll be lucky if you help even one.

Let’s say you recognize that giving to charities can make a profound impact in others’ lives and perhaps
you even believe it’s morally the right thing to do. Perhaps you once met someone who was blind and
now you are drawn to helping the blind. You’ve made the choice of a cause, but there are hundreds of
organizations that help the blind and thus seem deserving of your money.

Some think it inappropriate to compare charities and especially to criticize a decision about which
charity to give money to. But it is not just appropriate, it is supremely important. Your decision where to
give will determine whether 200 or just one person gets helped.

You find a US charity that trains guide dogs for the blind. It’s a commendably austere charity; over
99% of its received donations go directly to its goal: training the dogs. So you make your donation of
US$1,000 and are confident your money will be used well. Months later you receive a photo of the
dog with its new owner and you feel great, knowing you have helped provide a dog that will help its
owner ‘see’ for the next 10 years.

No one will say you’ve done a bad thing, and you haven’t. But you could have done something better.
You probably would have liked to help several people as much as you’ve helped the lucky recipient of
your guide dog – you just didn’t have much money to give. It turns out, you could have done far better;
you could have cured about 20 cases of blindness instead! Let’s see how.

Another organization, which you overlooked because it uses only 70% of its donations on its goal, works
in the developing world. Because of the low salary of third-world doctors and other factors, the cataract
surgery this organization focuses on costs about $35.[[1](#footnote-1)]

Let’s compare the two charities directly: via the first it costs $10,000 to train a guide dog and thus costs
about $1,000/year to provide a proxy for eyesight for a blind person. Via the second it costs about $35/
person and, even if they don’t live long, it costs no more than $5/year to restore sight to a blind person.
It seems reasonable to say you’ve done at least 200 times worse than you could have – if your goal was
to help as many people as you could. In this example, you’ve given 1 year of proxy for eyesight, rather
than 200 years of actual eyesight.

You may be skeptical of the numbers I’ve used, but I made them favorable to the first cause: one eye-
seeing dog charity claims it costs ‘$42,000 or more’ to train the dog and provide instructions to the
user.[[2](#footnote-2)] A cataract charity claims to be able to perform the procedure for $25. Even if you’re skeptical
that the costs may be higher in practice, they are unlikely to exceed $100/person.

I think it an important lesson to learn: what matters most is the cost-effectiveness of the intervention,
not the overhead costs of the organization. Choosing where to give may be more important than
whether to give at all. If your goal is to help as many people as possible, you’ll do more good by
comparing charities by the effects of every dollar you donate to them.

Choosing among the causes is important as well. For more information on that, read [The Best Causes](/blog/6-the-best-causes).

<div id="footnote-1"></div>
[1] To avoid singling out a specific charity for attack or acclaim, these numbers are approximate to the
average of existing charities that focus on the interventions.

<div id="footnote-2"></div>
[2] The figures used in this post are meant to make the dog-training charity look as
favorable as possible. One US charity claims it costs ‘approximately $42,000 or more’ per
dog ([guidedogsofamerica.org](http://www.guidedogsofamerica.org/1/mission/)) and their non-program expenses
are not 1% as in the example but about 30% ([charitynavigator.org](http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?
bay=search.summary&orgid=5841)).

Suppose you're looking to donate as much as possible to charity, and are choosing between two jobs. Should you worry about the taxes in each location? Since you can claim back taxes on charitable donations, many people think you don't need to worry about this issue.

In many western countries, charitable donations are in some way tax-exempt. In the UK the charity can claim back the normal rate of tax you paid on your donation, and you can claim back the higher rate tax you paid. In the US, you can use your charitable donations to reduce your tax liability in a similar way. So your charitable donations come out of your pre-tax income, rather than post-tax income. If you're not going to be made to pay tax on your substantial donations, you've made yourself tax-exempt to a considerable degree.

You might think that the tax environment doesn't make much difference to your ability to [Earn to Give](http://80000hours.org/earning-to-give). But this isn’t actually the case, for several reasons.

Firstly, you do still need to earn some money for yourself, and you'll pay tax on that. The lower the tax rates, the more you can spend on and invest in yourself - or, the lower the proportion of your pre-tax income you need to keep for yourself, so the more you can donate.

Secondly, it's quite possible that the best charity to support won't turn out to be a registered charity at all. What if you find a scrappy little start-up that's going to save the world, but is currently just three grad students in a basement? Donating to this group wouldn't be tax-exempt, so lower taxes will help you help them. Unless you think the government is always going to grant charitable status to the right people, this should be a concern; especially if you're interested in gambles with low odds but high payoffs.

Finally, legal uncertainty. Recently, both Obama in the US and Osborne in the UK recently attempted to end or substantially reduce the amount of tax relief we could get on charitable donations. While they were unsuccessful, it's possible that they might succeed next time. If you've invested a lot into a working in a particular area, and can't easily escape, you could have a lot to lose.

True, if you thought your country’s government would do more good with your money than any other group in the world, you won’t be worried about taxes, as you’ll be donating all the rest of your money to the government anyway (to the extent that you're altruistic). But this can’t be true for everyone. Even if (say) the Norwegian government really was the most effective organisation in the world, anyone who didn't live in Norway would (at the margin) want to reduce the amount of tax they paid as much as possible, so they could give it to the Norwegians instead.

However, taxes rates obviously aren’t the only things that matter. While low taxes might encourage growth, rich areas have lots of wealth for the government to seize - hence why New York, with the captive wealth of Manhattan and Wall Street, can afford to have the highest taxes in America. While a higher portion of your paycheck will be taken from you, a job at a big bank might pay sufficiently well that it’s still better than the average job you might get in Indiana.

Is there any research the idea of efficiency with respect to taxes vs. earnings among countries and localities? That is, in places with higher tax rates, companies would have to pay more in order to get people to live there? Or are migration patterns / location decisions not that efficient?

_If_ worldwide taxes were efficient in that sense, then altruists who could deduct taxes would benefit from going to places with the highest tax rates, because they would get more tax break than their colleagues. That said, if efficiency is not true, this would be a very bad strategy to pursue. In any event, hopefully you could get a sense of compensation levels as well as tax rates before you moved somewhere.

The point about donating to startup causes is a good one. A Donor Advised Fund can help (http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=123) when you want to wait to decide where to donate (or want to donate to a future charity that hasn't yet been created), but it can't help if you plan to donate to a bunch of small projects for which it's not worth the effort of registering a charity. (OTOH, maybe you could get an existing charity to fund that work for you.)]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>905</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Jeff Kaufman</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>jeff@alum.swarthmore.edu</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/jeff-kaufman</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-03-02 18:23:50</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Another consideration is that you may be limited in the amount of tax you can deduct.

Unfortunately much of the information you need doesn’t exist. For instance, you can easily find minimum entry requirements for different roles, but there’s isn’t much on how to judge your [chances of being successful](http://80000hours.org/blog/132-how-to-judge-your-chances-of-success) once you’ve got the job. We know some important useful things about finding a job that suits you, such as evidence-based ways to [judge whether you’ll enjoy](http://80000hours.org/blog/134-our-research-on-how-to-find-a-job-you-love) a particular job, but it isn’t covered by conventional careers advice. And it’s difficult to find any information at all about more entrepreneurial paths. 

On the other hand, the existing resources are great for certain types of information. Governments collect detailed information on types of roles, what they involve, what skills and qualifications are required, basic salary data and industry trends. There are also some private providers of career information and advice, including advice on how to get into certain types of jobs.

We’re going to prepare career profiles on specific careers that will help you work out whether to pursue that option. But in the meantime, here’s our first thoughts on the best resources that are already out there.

One word of caution about these sources - most of them are general career resources that cover many industries superficially and so they tend to summarise the most common aspects of the career rather than the most promising opportunities. For example, [C and Java are the most commonly used programming languages](http://www.langpop.com/), but that doesn’t mean they offer the best opportunities for a programmer just starting out.

##How to use the sources
I’d suggest that you:

* Use the BLS Occupational Outlook Handbook and some of the advice websites that list types of jobs to get an overview of the options available. 
* Then if you care about salary you can get more information on salaries for different jobs using the Occupational Employment Statistics site for an overview and salary.com for detail. 
* You can get a picture of what the jobs are like using ONET, Vault, and other general career advice resources. 
* Then you can get more information on particular companies and careers by looking at glassdoor, going to careers fairs, searching on Quora, and talking to people. 

Also, bear in mind that networking is very powerful - both for getting a more accurate picture of different careers and for actually getting a job, so only use online sources for getting the basics before you go out and talk to real people.

##Government data
Government data is probably the most accurate source for basic information on what jobs involve, salaries, skill requirements, hours, and industry trends. This data isn’t perfect though - one problem is that it doesn’t take account of earnings such as bonuses that are not part of the basic salary. This and other problems are outlined in [this post on the problems of salary data](http://80000hours.org/blog/24-5-ways-to-be-misled-by-salary-rankings).


###[Occupational Outlook Handbook](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/) from the US Bureau of Labour Statistics’

The online BLS Occupational Outlook Handbook has profiles on many broad categories of occupation. It’s a good place to look to find lists of different occupations when you’re just starting to think about your options. It also has job descriptions, skills required, pay, and work environment information. The section on job outlook is particularly useful - it’s important to try to work out the long term prospects of a career or industry.


###[Occupational Employment Statistics site](http://www.bls.gov/oes/) from the US Bureau of Labour Statistics’ 

They have [profiles for each occupation](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_stru.htm) which cover salaries broken down by percentiles, industries, and locations.


###UK Office of National Statistics Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings

Less detailed than the US BLS data but it covers earnings for different job categories. You can get the report [here](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ashe/annual-survey-of-hours-and-earnings/2012-provisional-results/stb-ashe-statistical-bulletin-2012.html) and the data [here](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-280149).


###[ONET](http://www.onetonline.org/)

ONET is a US Department of Labour website that contains detailed profiles on different occupations. It is the most systematic and evidence-based source we’ve found that covers what jobs involve and what skills are required. For each job it has a summary report and you can see all their data on each job by clicking on the details tab in one of the job profiles. 

To check the quality, I contacted ONET to find out how they gather this data. They send surveys out to a sample of people in each job and contact experts in each occupation.[^1] It’s great that they gather all this data, but there are some problems. For example, self-reported answers to questions about skills won’t be as accurate as a study of the skills determinants of success in a particular career. However, it is currently the best source we have that covers most careers and at least uses some systematic evidence to describe jobs. See also [this site](https://onet.rti.org/) for an overview of how they collect their data.

##Salary data for particular jobs

###[Salary.com](http://salary.com/)

Salary.com collates data on the salaries of jobs in the US that is more fine-grained than government data. They also categorise careers by seniority - for example, Software engineer I, II, and III - so you can trace expected earnings increases as you get promoted. Each job has both median and other percentile data and you can see salary + bonuses as well as basic salary.

Salary.com appears to be the best-quality non-government source of salary data. They take use employer-reported salaries and more than 90% of the job salaries listed take data from 100 or more people in that job.[^2] They also have data on salaries by location, but since they calculate it by adjusting national averages using a weighting factor rather than by presenting actual salary data by location it might be better to use the BLS occupational employment statistics handbook for location-based salary information.

###[Glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com)

Glassdoor’s salary data is taken from self-reports by people who register on the site and is displayed by company, so it’s less useful for getting an overview of salaries by job type. However, glassdoor is excellent for doing research when you’re thinking about which companies to apply to. As well as the salary data they have job adverts, reviews of each company by employees, and summaries of interviews at different companies written by people who have interviewed there.

##Career advice websites

These sites don’t simply present information from other sources - they write guides to different aspects of career planning. Because of this, it is hard to be sure of their quality. Make sure that check the advice you read with other sources and by talking to more experienced people.

###[Vault](http://www.vault.com/)

Vault is a source of career related analysis. Rather than just presenting data (like salary.com) or user-generated content (like glassdoor) vault provides written guides on many career topics. They have:
* [Profiles](http://www.vault.com/wps/portal/usa/companies) and [rankings](http://www.vault.com/wps/portal/usa/rankings/index) of companies in some industries.
* Profiles of [industries](http://www.vault.com/wps/portal/usa/industries) and [professions](http://www.vault.com/wps/portal/usa/professions)
* Overall [career advice](http://www.vault.com/wps/portal/usa/vcm/landing?category_id=1) 
* A long list of [day in the life profiles](http://www.vault.com/wps/portal/usa/vcm/listing/Career-Advice-Articles/Day-in-the-Life?category_id=20) 
* They also publish [Vault guides](http://www.vault.com/wps/portal/usa/store)
which are books on particular industries and other career-related information such as interviewing.

###[Wetfeet](https://www.wetfeet.com/)

Two sites:

You can register on [wetfeet.com](http://www.wetfeet.com) and get access to articles (of unclear quality) and more usefully, Q&As with hiring managers at major companies.

They also have [schools.wetfeet.com](http://schools.wetfeet.com/) which is a more comprehensive career advice site with [advice articles](http://schools.wetfeet.com/advice-tools), [testimonials](http://schools.wetfeet.com/employers) from people at various companies describing their work life and [guides](http://schools.wetfeet.com/guide) to help with getting a job.

###[Targetjobs](http://targetjobs.co.uk/)

UK-based. An advice site with job-search, employer profiles, summaries of different career sectors, and general career advice.

###[Careers in business](http://www.careers-in-business.com/)

Includes subsites on finance, consulting, and marketing, among others. It's particularly useful as a collection of links to other useful sites.

###[Prospects.ac.uk](http://prospects.ac.uk) 

A career advice website for UK students graduates with information on different careers and industries. See especially their list of [types of jobs](http://prospects.ac.uk/types_of_jobs.htm) which has profiles on many careers.

###University careers services

University careers service websites may be helpful. e.g. the [University of London’s careers group](http://www.graduatesintocareers.co.uk/) has advice as well as information on many different industries. Your local university careers service will also have a library of books and resources for career research.

###[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org)

Has articles on most jobs and industries. Useful for getting your bearings.


##Finding companies
Apart from the websites above (many of which contain company profiles) you could look at:

###Lists of top companies

For example, the Sunday Times [100 best companies to work for](http://features.thesundaytimes.co.uk/public/best100companies/live/template) or Vault’s [top 100 Law firms](http://www.vault.com/wps/portal/usa/rankings/individual?rankingId1=2&rankingId2=2&rankings). Google to find lists for your preferred industry.

###Careers fairs

Search for ones in your local area. Often they are organised by university careers services but there are also industry-specific fairs as well, such as the [Consultancy careers fair](http://www.theconsultancycareersfair.com/Exhibitors/WhyExhibit.aspx) and tech-startup careers fair [Siliconmilkroundabout](http://siliconmilkroundabout.com/)

##Other information

###[Quora](http://www.quora.com/)

A question-and-answer site that you can search - often the people answering are experienced professionals. It’s useful for getting an insider perspective on many jobs and is especially strong for tech jobs and non-technical jobs associated with the software industry (e.g. sales and online marketing).

###[Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/)

Like a search engine, but returns information rather than search results. It’s useful for finding career-relevant information such as the [cost of living in London](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=cost+of+living+london).

##Conclusion
Be cautious when using these sources - careers advice is hard and many of the sites don’t have an evidence-based approach. But they are a useful start in your careers research as long as you supplement them with advice from lots of people with experience of the careers you're interested in.

Let us know in the comments if you know of any good sources of careers advice.

*References and notes*

[^1]: From an email from ONET: “The primary method for collecting this information is the establishment method, a survey of workers employed in a national probability sample of establishments. This method essentially uses a stratified two-stage design in which businesses (the primary stage) are selected with probability proportional to the expected number of employed workers in the specific occupations being surveyed, and a sample of workers (the secondary stage) is selected in the occupations within the sampled businesses.  In addition to this primary method, alternative or supplementary methods include sampling from professional and trade association membership lists and sampling from lists of identified occupation experts.  …  It should be noted that ONET occupational information is composite information from many jobs and therefore is not intended to describe a particular job. With all methods, the ONET survey instruments [Questionnaires](http://www.onetcenter.org/questionnaires.html) are used.”

We've never said that in any of our materials. All we have said, for instance in [the paper we published on Earning to Give](http://www.academia.edu/3619295/Replaceability_career_choice_and_making_a_difference), is that there is strong reason to think that Earning to Give is better than taking a typical non-profit job.

When it comes to how to make the most difference with your career, we think there's huge room for debate. Whether it's best for someone to pursue Earning to Give normally depends on difficult to estimate empirical considerations unique to the situation, like some of those mentioned [here](http://80000hours.org/blog/69-how-good-are-the-best), whether your cause is more talent-constrained or funding-constrained, what other people are doing, and issues like what else you could do with an Earning to Give job. Often high earning jobs give you a useful platform to advance high impact causes independent of the money you donate yourself. When people have come to us in the past interested in pursuing Earning to Give, we've advised some to do it, and others not to do it. See our recent [intro video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oihS0Cx8Lcs) for some examples.

This is why we welcome a recent article by ex-Givewell employee Jonah Sinick on why Earning to Give might not be optimal. You can see the full article [here](http://lesswrong.com/lw/hjn/earning_to_give_vs_altruistic_career_choice/), with an extensive discussion attached. What follows are the key arguments. We look forward to getting clearer on the tough question of which people should do Earning to Give.

#Responses to Will MacAskill’s Considerations
In the article [To save the world, don’t get a job at a charity; go work on Wall Street](http://qz.com/57254/to-save-the-world-dont-get-a-job-at-a-charity-go-work-on-wall-street/), Will gives three considerations in favor of “earning to give.” I respond to these considerations below. What I write should be read as a response to the article, rather than to Will’s views. 

##Variance in cost-effectiveness of charities
Will MacAskill wrote:

*“… charities vary tremendously in the amount of good they do with the money they receive. For example, it costs about $40,000 to train and provide a guide dog for one person, but it costs less than $25 to cure one person of sight-destroying trachoma. For the cost of improving the life of one person with blindness, you can cure 1,000 people of it…it’s unlikely that you can work for only the very best charities. In contrast, if you earn to give, you can donate anywhere, preferably to the most cost-effective charities, and change your donations as often as you like.”*

GiveWell has spent about five years looking for the best giving opportunities in global health, and its current #1 ranked charity is [Against Malaria Foundation](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF) (AMF). GiveWell estimates that AMF [saves an infant’s life for ~ $2,300](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#Costperlifesaved), not counting other benefits. These other benefits not withstanding, AMF’s cost per [DALY saved ](http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/additional/DALY) is much higher than the implied cost per DALY saved associated with the figure cited for curing sight-destroying trachoma.

GiveWell may have missed giving opportunities in global health that are much more cost-effective than AMF is, but given the amount of time, energy and attention that GiveWell spent on its search, one should have a strong prior against the possibility that one can easily find a better giving opportunity in global health. So a plausible estimate of the cost-effectiveness of donating to the best charity that delivers direct global health interventions is much lower than the above quotation suggests.

Furthermore, the phenomenon of the [optimizer’s curse](http://lesswrong.com/lw/hif/robustness_of_costeffectiveness_estimates_and/91j7) suggests that all charities with robust case for fairly high cost-effectiveness are closer in cost-effectiveness to AMF than explicit cost-effectiveness calculations indicate. This narrows the variance in cost-effectiveness amongst charities. 

So the advantage of being able to choose a charity to support and change at any time is smaller than the above quotation suggests.

##Discrepancy in earnings

WIll MacAskill wrote:

*“Annual salaries in banking or investment start at $80,000 and grow to over $500,000 if you do well. A lifetime salary of over $10 million is typical. Careers in nonprofits start at about $40,000, and don’t typically exceed $100,000, even for executive directors ... By entering finance and donating 50% of your lifetime earnings, you could pay for two nonprofit workers in your place—while still living on double what you would have if you’d chosen that route.“*

The assumption “if you do well” is a very strong one. Only about 1% of Americans make ~$500k/year. There are some people who have a strong comparative advantage in finance, for whom “earning to give” to give may be especially compelling. But people who are able to make ~$500k/year in finance who **don’t** have a large comparative advantage in finance have **very strong transferable skills**. Such people are significantly more capable than the average non-profit worker, and can plausibly have a bigger impact than 2 or 3 such workers by working directly on something with high social value. 

##Replaceability

Will MacAskill wrote:

*”…“making a difference” requires [doing something that wouldn’t have happened anyway](http://80000hours.org/blog/18-just-what-is-making-a-difference-counterfactuals-and-career-choice)…The competition for not-for-profit jobs is fierce, and if someone else takes the job instead of you, he or she likely won’t be much worse at it than you would have been. So the difference you make by taking the job is only the difference between the good you would do, and the good that the other person would have done.”* 

I would guess that there are some highly cost-effective humanitarian interventions that are sufficiently easy to implement that the implementers are easily replaceable. I could easily imagine that this is the case for vaccination efforts. 

But funding opportunities for these interventions can be thought of as “low hanging fruit.” [Broad market efficiency](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/) suggests that such interventions will be funded. And indeed, GiveWell has found that straightforward immunization efforts [are already largely funded](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/03/21/trying-and-failing-to-find-more-funding-gaps-for-delivering-proven-cost-effective-interventions/), to the point that GiveWell has been unable to find giving opportunities for individual donors in this area. 

This suggests that at the margin, **very high value humanitarian efforts require highly skilled and highly motivated laborers.**
High skilled laborers are a relatively small subset of laborers, so there are fewer people available to do these sorts of jobs than other jobs. Doing a hard, non-routine job well requires high motivation.  The collection of people who are sufficiently highly motivated to do a hard job with high social value that doesn’t pay well, and who could otherwise be making much more money, largely consists of people who are trying to have a significant positive social impact. 

So suppose that you’re a highly skilled laborer deciding whether to “earn to give” or take a job with high social value that requires high skills and motivation. If you don’t take the job with high social value, your counterfactual replacement is likely be one of the following:

1.     Substantially less capable than you on account of having low skills, or low altruistic motivation.
2.     A highly skilled person with high motivation, *who would be doing something else with high social value if you had taken the job, and who can’t do this because they have to do the job that you would have done.*
3.     Nonexistent.

So the replaceability consideration carries less weight than it might seem.

Admittedly there’s a counterconsideration — broad market efficiency cuts both ways, and one could imagine that the low hanging fruit in *working directly on projects with high social value is also plucked*, and this counter-consideration pushes in favor of “earning to give.” I have a fairly strong intuition that “if you don’t fund it, somebody else will” is more true than “if you don’t do it, somebody else will” so that this counter-consideration is outweighed. It’s important to note that many projects of high social value are the first of their kind, and that finding somebody else to execute such a project is highly nontrivial. I think that it’s also relevant that [114 billionaires](http://givingpledge.org/) have signed the Giving Pledge, committing to giving 50+% of their wealth away in their lifetimes. 

In any case, there isn’t a clear-cut, unconditional argument that favors “earning to give”: whether “earning to give” is the best option very much depends on nuanced empirical considerations rather than a general abstract argument.

#Other important considerations that favor an altruistic career

There are additional important considerations that favor pursuing a career with high social value over “earning to give”:

##Asymmetric implications of the existence of small probability failure modes 

In [Robustness of Cost-Effectiveness Estimates and Philanthropy](http://lesswrong.com/lw/hif/robustness_of_costeffectiveness_estimates_and/), I described how a large collection of small probability failure modes conspires to substantially reduce the expected value of a funding opportunity. The same issue applies to choosing a narrow career goal with a view toward directly having a high positive social impact. But **a worker has more capacity than a donor does to learn whether small probability failure modes prevail in practice, and can switch to a different job if he or she finds that such a failure mode prevails.** 

Here’s an example. Suppose that you go to medical school with a view toward the possibility of performing cleft palate surgeries in the developing world. It’s probably the case that the opportunity isn’t as promising as it seems. But if you try it, then you’ll be able to see how effective the intervention is firsthand. If it’s highly effective, then you can keep doing it. If it’s not highly effective, then you can explore other possibilities, such as:

* Starting your own surgery organization.
* Switching to doing a different kind of surgery in the developing world, such as cataract removal.
* Working in a poor community in the developed world (which could have a bigger impact than working in the developing world owing to [flow-through effects](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/)).
* Working for a biotech company.
* Getting involved in clinical medical research.
* Other things that haven't occurred to me.

By experimenting, one can hope to hone in on a job that has both high ostensible cost-effectiveness, and and a relatively small mass of small probability failure modes.

##Altruistic careers extend beyond the nonprofit world

Even on the assumption that “earning to give” is better than working at a nonprofit, it doesn’t follow that “earning to give” optimizes social impact. There are ways to have a positive social impact in the for-profit world, in scientific research, and in the government.

##Historical Precedent

For the most part, the people who have had the biggest positive impact on the world haven’t had their impact by “earning to give.”
There are a few possible exceptions, such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, whose philanthropic activities could be having a huge impact (though it’s hard to tell from the outside) and could well outstrip the value that they contributed through their labor. But they appear to have an unusually high ratio of wealth to direct positive impact of their work, and so appear to be unrepresentative.

Steve Jobs’ highest net worth was on the order of $10 billion, whereas Bill Gates’ highest net worth was on the order of $100 billion. I don’t think that Bill Gates contributed 10x as much as Steve Jobs to technology, and I don’t think that Jobs could have had a bigger social impact by donating than through his work (which had massive positive [flow-through effects](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/)). I acknowledge that Jobs is a cherry picked example, but I think that the general principle still holds. 

##Mainstream consensus

Few people think that “earning to give” is the best way to make the world a better place. This could be attributable to irrationality or to low altruism, but my experience is that there are many people who care about global welfare, or just welfare within a specific cause, and many people who are highly intelligent. In light of the existence of [illusory superiority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority), one should be wary of holding an implicit view that one knows more about how to make the world a better place than the vast majority of the population.

#Steelmanning wealth maximization

It’s worth highlighting some factors that favor choosing a career with a view toward maximizing wealth in some situations:

* **Comparative advantage** — Some people are unusually good at making money relative to doing other things. Such people may do better to “earn to give” than to try to choose a job that has a direct positive impact (which they’re relatively bad at).
* **The market mechanism** — In the for-profit world, maximizing wealth is often correlated with maximizing positive social impact, and so can be used as a proxy goal for maximizing positive social impact.
* **Connections and personal growth** — People with high earnings are generally more capable and more knowledgeable than people in other contexts, and tend to be well connected, so positioning oneself among such people can increase one’s prospects of soaring to greater heights. Jeff Bezos [started his career](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos#Business_career) in finance, and later created Amazon, which has had massive positive social impact (both direct, and via [flow-through effects](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/)).
* **Unusual values** — If one cares about causes that very few people care about, then it could be difficult to find funding for work on them, so “earning to give” could be necessary. I don’t believe this to be the case, but it’s a consideration that's been raised by others, and so is worth mentioning.

#Closing summary 

There are many arguments against the claim that “earning to give” is generally the best way to maximize one’s positive social impact, and I believe that choosing a job where one can do as much good as possible through one’s work is generally the best way to maximize one’s positive social impact. However, for some people in unusual situations, “earning to give” may be the best way to have a positive social impact.

I completely see where the perspective of “earning to give” comes from - in fact, I started my career down this path. But having realized that such an approach would involve the promotion of an unfair and inefficient state of things in the society, I have come to think of it as a bit dangerous, unless it is done very consciously and cautiously. I think we need to break down the fundamental assumptions here and determine what “reality” we are willing to not only accept but also promote. 

Here are a few assumptions being made:  
1. It is ethical and not ineffective to pay less to those in careers making a huge difference than to those in other careers. Besides just being completely backwards, this also seems to promote lower expectations in the quality of the work performance for those in the non-profit field.
2. It is ethical and not counter-productive that we promote a society where there is a stark choice between high-earning and high-impact. If we want to attract the best minds and brightest talent into careers that are high-impact, we could do better by eliminating that choice altogether. If we pay for-profit and non-profit/ public sector talent comparably at each level (more in both cases when there is more responsibility and better results), that in turn achieves at least 4 positive effects: 
a. Everyone has the ability to give away a certain percentage based on their income and those making more, no matter what field they chose can give away more. 
b. The ones most likely to give more are the ones touched by meaningful causes. It is this same group that will likely choose careers in non-profit/ public good. By paying that group more, we can channel more money towards the causes. 
c. We can eliminate some of the “unethical” careers by cutting out their unique advantage of high-income.
 d. We can prevent burn-out/ drop-outs from lack of appreciation/ rewards in non-profit sector. 
3. It is possible and easy to not do “bad” while earning more. When the goal is to maximize profits, it is more common to take those short-cuts – outsource to countries where there are human rights abuses and poor labor conditions, use materials with the potential to be dangerous to humans or animals, disregard environmental impact, etc. Take for instance, the CEO of a company that masterfully markets a sugary-children’s drink using advanced techniques based on child-psychology and parent-psychology research and then donates a percentage of his/her income to diabetes prevention research - what is the net gain to society from that individual? When considering the net impact you can have (good minus bad), it seems like there is really rare scenario when this can be worked out highly positive. However, there is some positive trend in this arena with the rising of social enterprise and impact investment.

One caveat here: I do understand that high income is not as much of a motivator as some other factors. But this kicks in practically only after a certain level of income, and unfortunately most professionals in the public and non-profit sector today, irrespective of their talent levels, can never reach that level. Further research on this seems worthwhile. 

A couple of other positives:
Work that promotes a general perception among the public that non-profit work is “cool” and involves “smarts” will bring in more general trust to that sector and hence more donations as well. Also, the timing for this approach seems right (i.e. young professionals today can likely make a difference within their lifetimes) because the rise of corporate responsibility and social enterprise seems to be breaking down of these walls between for-profit and for-social benefit. 

In general, I would think recommending a more balanced approach of leveraging your talent to work the market for a good cause seems more appropriate (social enterprise and impact investing).  

Thoughts/ Critiques welcome.

1) I totally agree with your concerns expressed in 3 but: the right minded individual might be able to navigate his company away from some of the harm it would cause if he or she were not there. So while he or she is at risk of becoming corrupt, they might actually be an agent for good, especially if they are supported by a community like 80,000 hours.

2) I think we should allow markets to determine wages, and then use these wages to do good, not the other way around. The financial sector in the US and elsewhere might be too big, corrupt and unproductive. Some other sectors may be equally reprehensible. Putting that aside, we can look at generally positive high-earning sectors like technology (I know there are many problems here too - but perfection is nothing more than an ideal). If a compnay makes a product millions and billions of people use, and they monitize it properly, there will be a lot of profit there. This is simple math, nothing more or less. Imposing external meassures to subvert this is bound to encounter, at the very least, some unintended consequence. So you are right that not every high-earning job is a good moral choice (working for Exxon and donating to Greenpeace seems at best to amount to doing nothing), but there are plenty good choices out there.

3) Paying the non-profit sector as much as the for-profit sector is simply not required. Anyone who decides to make money for money's sake, or some other benefit to themselves, is ill-suited to work in a highly effective non-profit. Those who choose the 80,000 hour route are rewarded by knowing that they have a positive impact on the world. That can be seen as a perk of the job.
Think of the loop you are creating anyway: if workers in non-profits were high-earners, the right thing for them to do would be to donate the money back to the non-profit...

One thing I fail to understand is why effective altruists never consider the corrupting power of “earning to give” (or, put more simply, money and power). I genuinely want to do good in the world, but I also recognize that such a wish means swimming against the stream in many walks of life - most people will not understand my motivation or my actions. They may even discourage me, intentionally or unintentionally. In a non-profit sector job, however, this will not be the case. Co-workers will, ideally, be as highly motivated as I, and my close friends and family will find what I am doing less unfathomable. In other words, the more a job is purely profit oriented, the more I fear the corporate atmosphere will erode my desire to make a positive impact. I would love to discover that I am idiosyncratic in this respect, that other people take the pledge to give 10 or more % and never look back.

We have an on-going project to help you work out which career path has the highest expected earnings for you. Over the next couple of months, we’d like to show you:
* Where to get the data to make your own estimates. The best general sources we know right now are [here](http://80000hours.org/blog/149-the-best-resources-for-planning-your-career).
* A couple of methods for making your own estimates, plus common pitfalls.
* Tables of expected earnings by profession, broken down by skill level.
* Detailed estimates for some of the most interesting and tricky cases, like jobs in finance

<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/velo_city/76416689/'><img alt="Dollars" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/96/large/dollars.jpg?1361441458" /></a>

Currently, you can only find tables of median earnings by profession. Unfortunately, median earnings don’t translate into your *expected* earnings. This is partly because income distributions tend to be skewed - the top half of the population has a wider range of salaries (including some very high salaries) than the bottom half. The other reason is that you probably have some information about how good you’ll be - so ideally you want to know what the salaries are for different levels of the profession and what your chances are of getting promoted. And there are further problems with this data - [this post](http://80000hours.org/blog/24-5-ways-to-be-misled-by-salary-rankings) outlines some of them. These problems become all the more pressing with jobs that have a wide spread in outcomes and high drop-out rates, like those in finance.

So can we do any better? In this post I’m going to guide you through one of the best sources of earnings information - salary.com - and show you how to use it. See [this post](http://80000hours.org/blog/149-the-best-resources-for-planning-your-career) for other websites for getting earnings and general career information.

##What is salary.com?
There are lots of sites for working out salaries for different careers, but we’ve found that salary.com is the most useful because:
* It’s easy to browse through lists of job titles - you don’t have to search separately each time or enter lots of information.
* Their job categorisations are narrow enough that they reflect real jobs and wide enough that you can get a quick overview.
* Their job categorisation includes levels of seniority, so you can estimate how your salary will rise as you get promoted.
* Their [methodology](http://bayarea.salary.com/docs/salwizhtmls/methodology.html) is good. Data is gathered from employers, not from people using the website, so it should be fairly solid. And 90% of the jobs listed have salaries calculated from more than 100 people in the job, so small sample size shouldn’t be a problem.

##How to use salary.com for salary estimations
The most useful part of their website is the [salary wizard](http://www.salary.com/category/salary/) where you can search or browse jobs. 

Search for jobs that you’re interested in, and try to find job descriptions that have levels of seniority (which are the ones with roman numerals after the name e.g. Software Engineer III). Then for each job you can view:
* The proportions of the people in that job who have a certain level of experience and education. 
* Data on salary + bonus for different levels of earnings within a job.

One way to go from here is to:
* Find a job which has several levels of seniority listed on salary.com
* Make a graph for each level of seniority that shows the different levels of pay for that seniority.
* Look at how much experience is normally required to get promoted to each level.
* You could either just get an overview from looking at these graphs or you could do a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation what you think you’ll earn. You can do this by making assumptions about how fast you’ll get promoted and how good you’ll be within each level of seniority.
* You can then do this for other jobs and compare.

In a future post, we’ll take this further and show how to do calculations based on salary.com data to estimate your lifetime earnings.

From a brief glance, it looks like Salary.com only shows averages for the job, while GlassDoor.com shows them for individual companies.

Good point about matching skill-sets to salaries by looking at representative companies. Salary.com shows data for different salary percentiles, but it’s tricky to know where in that distribution you’ll lie. I’ll think about how we could incorporate glassdoor data into expected earnings estimations.

We recommend GiveWell as a leading source of information on where to have the largest impact with your charitable donations.

Our conversation suggested that GiveWell might be one of the highest impact career opportunities in the world. There's reason to think that GiveWell has the potential to be an extremely impactful organisation, but they are short of some key types of staff. If you fit their criteria, then this is a position really worth considering. Read on for excerpts from our conversation to find out (i) what GiveWell does and why it's important (ii) what kind of people will do well there and (iii) how you can get a job there.

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/116/original/givewell_logo.gif?1364487988'><img alt="Givewell_logo" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/116/large/givewell_logo.gif?1364487988" /></a>

**Summary of who GiveWell is looking for**

>‘The kind of person who should work at GiveWell is probably super excited and enthusiastic about working at GiveWell, is intelligent, talented, is particularly good at synthesising research efficiently (cutting through issues quickly, thinking critically about things and taking apart studies, \[these\] are things that should feel natural), is an intense direct person who is comfortable in an intense direct environment where there’s a lot of discussion, debate, going back and forth, and someone who’s very self-directed, who can come up with their own plan that is efficient and productive. I think that for someone who would be a good fit for GiveWell, this kind of profile would sound extremely exciting to them and they would apply.’

# Why is this a high impact opportunity?
## Is GiveWell high impact?

GiveWell is driving forward evidence-based, impact focused charity evaluation, and has already caused million of dollars to be spent more effectively.

>‘There is a lot of generosity in the world but there’s a huge shortage of resources to help direct that generosity effectively. There’s a lot of people having conversations, that might be behind closed doors about how to have the most impact with their giving, but when you look at the state of public discussion around these issues today, it tends to be very low quality, very scattered, it doesn’t tend to be data driven or data informed. It’s conventional wisdom that all giving is kind of equally good, \[that\] people should follow their personal passions when giving and there’s very little in the way of hard headed public analysis informing the debate. I don’t think that there is no hard headed analysis at all, but a lot of the discussions about how to do good are taking place at foundations or in private conversations.’

>‘What GiveWell is trying to do is we’re trying to make it more public, more open, more transparent and create a public place where people can go, that starts a debate about how do I do as much good as possible with my giving. We want to take the world from what it is today to a place where there’s a lot of discussion, there’s a lot of debate, there’s a lot of analysis. We don’t necessarily want to be the only ones doing that, but we’re starting the discussion by making the best arguments we can, and that leads to more important giving.’

>‘And now we have individual donors giving anywhere between a dollar and a quarter million dollars, coming to our website, giving to our top charities. It’s been roughly doubling every year and so I think that’s gonna be a lot of impact in the future. And that doesn’t count the larger donors such as [Good Ventures](http://www.goodventures.org/).’

Since we spoke to Holden Karnofsky, GiveWell published its [annual review for 2012](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/03/12/givewell-annual-review-for-2012-details-on-givewells-money-moved-and-web-traffic/). GiveWell tracked $9.57 million in donations to its recommended charities which it can [confidently attribute](http://www.givewell.org/about/impact#MoneyMovedDefinition) to its research. Moreover, as you can see in the chart below, GiveWell’s money moved is many times larger than its operating expenses.

## How much impact can you have by working at GiveWell?
GiveWell is finding it hard to fill positions with suitable people, and so it seems that if you get a job at GiveWell, you will be highly [irreplaceable](http://80000hours.org/blog/35-the-replaceability-effect-working-in-unethical-industries-part-1). 

>‘We have had trouble expanding our team at the rate that we’d like. That’s the big challenge we’re facing; we really want to grow our team, we really want to grow our capacity, but the fact of the matter is that anyone you hire is a big upfront investment of managerial time. They need to be trained, they need to be evaluated to assess their strengths and weaknesses, they need to be managed. And so if we hire someone, unless they’re really good, then it could even be a net negative investment of our time.’

>‘In general I think the work we’re doing at GiveWell, it’s really hard and it takes a long time horizon, and it doesn’t really bear the kind of financial returns that people traditionally look for from that kind of work. Maybe this also reduces the number of people who are excited to work on something like this.’

>‘The best thing that could happen for us is that someone shows up with some combination of an impressive resume and impressive engagement with our research and thoughts on our research, and they’re available for a trial hire, for three months, ideally in San Francisco. If that person worked out, we would hire them.’

### What kind of marginal projects would a new hire work on?

>‘There’s a lot we need done. There’s two sides to GiveWell right now. There’s the part of GiveWell that focuses on proven cost-effective interventions. So that’s things like [bed nets](http://www.againstmalaria.com/Default.aspx), [cash transfers](http://www.givedirectly.org/) and [deworming](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto), and those are the things that we already promote. We need to research more of those. There are certain things that might be in the category of proven cost-effective but we’re not sure, for example various nutrition interventions. There are things that might not be quite as proven as the things we have but still pretty good and could expand our list of top charities, for example things like clean water provision. So we need those things researched. We need a constant search for charities that work on \[these things\], and then we need those charities evaluated, and then we need our existing charities evaluated. And that’s all a matter of having as many options as possible, having as many top charities as possible, to absorb the dollars that we’re eventually gonna need to absorb.’

>‘That’s one side of GiveWell. The other side of GiveWell is broadening, and going into what one might call a no holds barred approach to giving, where you’re acting a bit like a foundation and saying I can do anything, what’s the best way to spend money? That can involve all sorts of other causes. We’ve thought about political advocacy, we’ve thought about what we call meta-research, which is trying to improve the incentives for academic researchers to produce more value.’

>‘That takes very open ended investigations. There are like 50 causes that could plausibly be really good causes. But we need to prioritise them intelligently. So how can you efficiently spend a little time on a cause, get a better sense of whether it’s a good one, then spend more time, then eventually go deep enough on it to find good giving opportunities and evaluate those? That’s very difficult work.’

This second type of work is done at    [GiveWell Labs](http://www.givewell.org/about/labs).

>‘One way to think about it is that people who do the first kind of work well, are freeing up our capacity for the second type of work, and people who do the second type of work well, are freeing up our capacity to do the first type of work.’

>‘The point is, there’s a huge amount that GiveWell wants to do, and that its customers want it to do, and we will not have the capacity to do it well, unless we hire more people. So basically this vision of a group that both offers the best you can find in terms of proven cost-effective charities, but also has a really deep, really intelligently thought through strategy for a no holds barred impact, that is not going to happen unless we can hire more people.’

>‘That’s all on the research front. Eventually we will also need to improve our outreach efforts and improve our website and improve the way we sell and the way we market and the way we package. Those are all things that we basically don’t prioritise at all right now. Our growth is pretty strong and so it’s not a huge priority right now, but eventually we will need to do a better job with that. This vision of an organisation that’s having all the impact it can have on the marketing front, on the research front, on the packaging front, in terms of being thorough and in terms of being well supported and up to date in all the things that it thinks about, that could take a really huge team. The people who join now will have a crucial role in the development of that vision. We’re looking for people now who will play leadership roles as the team grows’ 

# Is it for you?
## What is the work like?
>‘GiveWell is a type of work that isn’t clearly the same as any other type of work. There are certainly things that are similar; there’s academic work, especially in econometrics; maybe what people do when they are evaluating companies is similar to parts of what we do; there are parts of what we do that resemble journalistic investigation, but there’s nothing I can say, okay you did this, so you will do our job well.’

>‘We definitely put a lot more work into synthesising research than into coming up with new research - obviously we don’t really do original research, we only synthesise. We put a lot of attention into synthesising things critically and assessing whether they’re persuasive above all else.’
## What kind of people do well?
>‘The number one predictor of success at GiveWell would be, has someone, or can someone engage with our recommendations and our research and make critical feedback on it and productive contributions to the discussion.’

>‘A good quality for GiveWell is being comfortable in a very intense direct environment. We tend to be direct with each other, we tell each other what we’re doing well, what we’re not doing well. If someone does something wrong, we all say this went wrong, how can we stop this from happening again. There’s not a lot of time to beat around the bush.’

## What opportunities does it provide for long-term career development?
GiveWell is growing fast and has just [partnered](http://blog.givewell.org/2012/06/28/givewell-and-good-ventures/) with a [multibillion dollar foundation](http://www.goodventures.org/), so there is going to be a lot of opportunity to advance within GiveWell. 

You will also get heavy training in highly useful information skills like surveying and synthesising large bodies of research, and applying it to practical situations, as well as getting leading training in cost-effectiveness analysis, which is a growth area in non-profits and foundations.

If you want to keep your options open and you are considering doing a PhD or going to work at GiveWell, then doing a PhD will probably keep your future options more open. If you are considering working at the World Bank or GiveWell, then working at the World Bank is probably more of a passport to future careers, as it is more famous.

# Who is GiveWell looking for?
>‘[One] thing that I would say that makes someone a good fit would be someone who is comfortable evaluating research, especially econometric research. That’s a skillset that we’re particularly interested in right now. Someone who can take a bunch of studies, understand the strengths and weaknesses and pull it all together and tell us what they say. There are people who we train in that, but ideally our next new hires would have that ability and be able to hit the ground running. \[Also\] asking critical questions in general, coming up with ways something might not work when people assume it works is a good quality.’

>‘So far we’ve taken people from undergrad. I’m not actually sure whether that’s been the best thing to do or not. We’ve certainly gotten some good people from undergrad who are with us now. Previously we knew little enough about what we were looking for, that we didn’t want to go more senior, when we weren’t sure whether those extra credentials would have a pay off. Right now we’re thinking about looking a little more senior - at least master’s level in economics and public health, for someone who will definitely have the skills to evaluate studies. I’m not sure that a PhD is necessary. In general [we are looking for] people with a strong understanding of economics, econometrics, public health methodologies and study methodologies. That’s a good skill for GiveWell. But that’s certainly not the only thing; \[being\] independent, self-directed, those are also important qualities.’

**Would GiveWell ever consider hiring a non-US citizen?**

>‘In most cases it is too difficult, but I wouldn’t rule it out. We’ve done it in the past. It’s hard, we want people to be in person. It’s not an absolute requirement; if someone is outstanding and they want to try telecommuting, that’s a possibility, but we generally want people to be in person. It is a big investment to try and get someone a visa and it’s hard but if someone did a trial and they were outstanding we would consider it.’

## If you want to work at GiveWell, what should you do next?
>‘[First], read our [blog](http://blog.givewell.org/), engage with it, and post comments, not just for the sake of posting comments, but when you have critical questions, critical feedback. You can also read our [website](http://www.givewell.org/), and come up with things that you see and that you’re thinking about and send them to us. That’s one way to demonstrate qualification for GiveWell. [Second], pick up some of the ability to assess studies in the area of economics and public health. In general anything that’s on your resume that’s just generally impressive or just shows that someone is accomplished, that they’ve done well, that stuff always helps.’

_The flat margin effect (FME)_: If you take a job that seems to have a strong (positive or negative) impact on the economy, the actual difference it makes to social welfare will be minimal.

So who is this relevant to? And why should you believe it?

On the first question, it’s relevant to any effective altruist thinking of taking a job in something like finance, which they’re concerned will contribute to an industry that harms the wider economy. Perhaps you don’t agree with the replacement effect, or perhaps you think it doesn’t apply in your case for some reason (maybe you’re going to be such an effective banker that you’ll actually make a big difference to the industry’s success).

It might also apply to people considering startups whose product would contribute to the economy (for example business-to-business services), who are wondering how much the positive value from doing so weighs against a higher income than they might get from following another path.

Unlike the replacement effect, it doesn’t apply - or at least not as much - to jobs where you directly improve people’s welfare (such as becoming a doctor). It will still be relevant to any economic effects these jobs might have beyond the direct good (or bad) they do.

As for why you should believe it, let me explain with an example. The New Economics Foundation estimates that bankers [remove £7](http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/bit-rich) from the UK economy for every pound they earn.(1) But using money as a metric only works if you have a sense of where the money would have otherwise been spent.

To answer that question, we need to consider where this economic damage is inflicted. Two likely answers to this are on the public and on the government - on current (UK) tax rates, at about a [63:37 ratio on average](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_Kingdom). First, let’s consider the impact that a loss of income can have on individuals.

## A case study of individual spending

Suppose Karl has a weekly income (after tax) of £500, which he typically uses something like this:

* £100 on rent
* £30 on bills
* £30 on transportation
* £90 on food for home preparation
* £40 on eating out with friends
* £100 into long-term savings
* £50 into saving for a forthcoming skiing holiday
* £20 on clothes
* £80 on books, music and other minor luxuries

Now I’ll disrupt this rosy picture by introducing a destructive banker. Via the magic of thought-experiment vagary, he damages the local economy to the extent that Karl’s company, while still solvent, has to cut his income by 10%. Accordingly, he has to subtract £50 from his weekly expenditures

Assuming Karl’s a faintly rational sort, he’s going to find the expenditure that brings him the least satisfaction - presumably his luxuries - and subtract it from there. So while losing the money might inconvenience him, rather than doing so to the tune of the average £50 he spends, it's going to inconvenience him to the equivalent of the _worst £50 he would otherwise have spent_.

## Marginal government spending

So how would a comparable loss of income affect the government?  Much the same, for exactly the same reason. If we assume the government is fairly rational and benevolent (choke back your mirth; I’ll revisit this hypothetical in the objections below), any money that comes out of its budget is going to come from its least effective spending.

My assumptions so far are are quite damning toward banking - I’m supposing bankers are taking large sums of money from an organisation that would otherwise have spent them wisely. So just how bad would it be?

Let's have a quick look at real numbers. We know the NHS spend up to £30,000 to buy a [QALY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year) - because [they tell us](http://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/features/measuringeffectivenessandcosteffectivenesstheqaly.jsp). 

So even if we also assume (with no particular reason to) that the NHS is the worst of the UK government's expenditures, our antisocial banker only needs to donate 4p per £10 he earns to make up the difference,(2) so long as he does so to [the best causes](http://80000hours.org/blog/6-the-best-causes-updated) - and that’s ignoring the replaceability effect. Everything after that is of net benefit to the world.

## Hang on a second...

This is a controversial claim, so I’m going to anticipate a few objections - and concede some ground to one of them:

_1) Why not just get a job that doesn’t do_ any _harm?_

If you can find a job that pays the same as a finance role and does less harm (or more good, depending on your perspective), then great. But most jobs pay far less, and as an effective altruist, the value you can get from the extra money would be enormous. 

Even a moderate-sounding difference in the income from two jobs can make a big difference to your positive impact. As your income rises, it becomes easier to give away a higher percentage of your salary, effectively volunteering yourself for progressive taxation. 

A banker on £500K a year can easily give away 80% of his income, effectively gaining £394,000’s worth of £50-QALYs on the above estimation (and still not accounting for the replaceability effect, which would make it almost a round £400K’s worth of QALYs). A nearly-as-successful businessman whose job’s social impact was neutral would clearly struggle to do anywhere near as well on an annual salary of, say, £400K. 

_2) Are you kidding? The government isn’t rational_ or _benevolent!_

Everyone will have a different view on this objection, and I’m not going to argue the point. But if anything, it makes my case for me: the less benevolent or rational the government tends to be, the less problematic it is to take money from them in the first place. Under a truly irrational rule, had your job not destroyed that £7, it might have been used to plant teddy bears in the Thames.

The same idea holds for individuals - the worse Karl is at using his money to satisfy his life-goals, the less he’s harmed by losing some of it. 

_3) This is all very well in theory, but I know that my government is cutting spending in areas that_ aren’t _the least efficient._

I’m very cautious of such claims, on the grounds that I think [politics is the mind-killer](http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/). If that argument is right, all of us should have much lower confidence in our political views than we usually do.

That said, assuming you do have reliable information to this effect, a couple of factors might mitigate it. 

Firstly, how _much_ worse are the cuts than they might be? We needn’t assume every cut will be perfect (indeed, that would imply a perfectly rational government who would spend the money even better than effective altruists).

Assuming a human government, it would be incredible if the cuts were to come from precisely the most efficient areas. It would be like trying to peel an orange without removing a single bit of the pulp - requiring so much effort it would ultimately be counterproductive. But as long as we can expect the cuts to tend toward the edges, the overall effect is much the same.

Secondly, governments don’t allocate all spending centrally. They tend to cut from departments, local councils etc, who then have to reallocate the remaining budget internally. And departments, like governments, have cause to behave broadly rationally. For example, if the NHS were to lose a sizable proportion of its budget, we would expect it to come from the treatments that cost £30,000 per QALY, rather than those which cost only a few hundred pounds .

Thirdly, if your information is about a specific policy the government is planning to implement, odds are the decision will have been made long before you can make a career change.

So for the FME not to apply (given that you’re contemplating a career where it might), you need to be able to predict a long-term government tendency to make particularly inefficient cuts iff the annual GDP warrants it, and otherwise to leave the status quo untouched. If you can predictably their irrationality but not the form it will take then the comments in 2) apply.

_4) It’s wrong to harm people, regardless of whether you’re doing it to benefit others._

A full response to this would be far too large for this blog post, since it would need to address the underlying assumptions about morality. In lieu of a full argument against it, I would argue that most people don’t really behave as though this is true: 

If you think it’s wrong ever to harm (or collude in harming) people for others’ benefit, do you agree that war is ever justified?

If so, obviously in some cases it’s permissable to harm others.

If not, do you minimise your income in order to minimise the funding your national military receives from your tax?

If so, then I can only admire your dedication and respectfully disagree on this issue.

If not, then you are already colluding in harm for prudential reasons, but for far less humanitarian benefit.

_5) You seem to be assuming any damage to the economy will be evenly spread. What if it’s the poorest people whose livelihood suffers the most?_

I actually think this is a valid objection - if this happens, it could substantially weaken the FME. I’ll say two things against it, though:

Firstly, it’s unlikely that that high a proportion of the wealth will come from the poorest people’s pockets, simply because their pockets are relatively small to begin with. Trivially, someone with no income can’t suffer from a proportionate income reduction. This capping effect probably isn’t that large, though - the relative poor in the UK have enough wealth between them to account for fairly large economic losses. However, it does scale well enough for us to draw an a priori probability inference: any loss to the economy is most likely to come from the area of median salary ([approx £22,800](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_in_the_United_Kingdom)) since that's where [the biggest pool of money is (PDF)](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/income_distribution/3-6table-feb2012.pdf). 

I'll go into more depth in a subsequent post, since it seems too much of a digression here, but for now I don’t think we should _assume_ the poor are hit disproportionately to the middle classes - in fact we should think it quite unlikely, unless we have strong evidence to the contrary. (In the next post I'll argue that even if they are, the negative effect is less than we might think, but again that's too much of a digression here)

For now, I'll concede that some further research on where economic damage tends to hit would help give a sense of how big a factor this is. 

Secondly, my argument isn’t that the FME completely cancels economic harm, only that it shows it to be substantially less pronounced than one might think. Given that the government receives over a third of the value of UK GDP (and similar amounts in other developed countries), that alone makes the effect quite powerful. If the spread of damage does turn out to be relatively even, the effect will be huge.

***

(1) Plenty of people would argue that banking [has a positive effect](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/opinion/kristof-is-banking-bad.html?_r=4&ref=global-home). This is broadly irrelevant to the argument for the FME - the margins look flat in both directions - though obviously it means you might apply it differently. 

(2) This is a slightly simplistic calculation, only considering the governmental aspect:

£10 earned subtracts (on the above estimate) £70 of value of the overall economy. If 30K-per-QALY treatments on the NHS are the worst government expenditure, then I assume the £70 comes from there, in which case the banker's job costs 0.0023 QALYs in economic harm. The  current best cause as judged by Giving What We Can and Givewell buys one QALY for approximately US$25, or £15.56 at current exchange rates, so an effective altruist could buy back the 0.0023 of a QALY for slightly less than four pence.

Point taken. It's difficult to promote pro phil without angering both left and right. This is one example. If you pretend certain high earning careers, like banking, are not harmful, then you anger the left. If you consider the fact that they might be, then you anger the right.

In practice, we talk so much about banking because it's the most salient example of a high earning career that is widely regarded as 'unethical.' If you can make the case for pro phil with banking, then it follows for all the other (legal) high earning careers.

Good point about foreign aid. GWWC recently did some research that suggested the cost-effectiveness of US health aid could be better than NTDs. We suspect there's a serious problem with the estimate, but nevertheless, it's looking like it might be pretty cost-effective. Then, cuts to health aid would be difficult to offset by donations to health charities.

Zander, I think I've understood your argument, but I'd like to clarify.  The FME is basically saying, "Whatever positive or negative externalities your job has, they will be completely swamped by the good you can do as an effective altruist."  Is that the core of it?  If so, I think it is worth mentioning explicitly in the introduction that it applies to effective altruists (present or future).  As it is currently written, it took me quite a while to work out what I think is the overall structure of the argument.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>345</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Zander Redwood</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>editor@80000hours.org</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/zander-redwood</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-05-15 17:06:28</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Re Lip:

'your knowledge of biases can harm you if you use them only to attack the views of others'

I don't mean to attack any particular views with this. Many 80K members won't have come across that sequence before, so the argument that we should take a step back from traditional politics might be genuinely new to them. (I should also point out that Ryan advised I delete that comment from the piece, but I decided it was an important enough point to be worth retaining)

Your point about foreign aid is a good one - governments might predictably act in favour of their constituents. I think the points in my third response still apply to some degree, but it seems likely to be one of the main factors working against the FME.

'can we stop with the absurd banker-bashing?'

I didn't mean to assume banking is harmful, but the argument is primarily relevant to 80K members who *do* think they're harmful, so I was addressing the piece to them. I'm sceptical of the NEF claim too, but it's the only attempt I know to formally quantify the supposed harm of banking, hence it being the one I chose. What's your reason for dismissing them as absurd, though? As Ben says, sticking to one particular political view (however justified you might think it is) risks alienating half our members, and part of my purpose in writing this piece was to try to reduce the left/right divide by showing that (one of) the typical differences in opinion between them is far less important than people make it out to be. 

Re David Barry

That's basically it (strictly speaking what you say is a consequence of the FME when combined with the separate argument that EAs can do huge amounts of good with money), although I'd restrict it to economic externalities. Obviously if you pollute a local water supply, the harm it's going to do won't be spread out over as many people, nor so irrelevant to their wellbeing. I've adjusted the phrasing of the 'who's it relevant to' paragraph re your suggestion.

1) Does the banking industry as it harm the economy?

1.1) (if so) is it inevitably harmful, or might it have a positive effect in different circumstances?

2) Do people in the banking industry tend to do harmful (or at least less good things than the average person) with their money (eg lobbying govt for self-interested reform)

2.1) If so, is that an accident of culture, or are the requirements for entering banking such that it’s biased towards attracting such people?

I suspect the answer to 2) is ‘yes’, at least to the weaker parenthetical version (if nothing else high earners [tend to donate smaller proportions of money](http://www.cgap.org.uk/uploads/Briefing%20Papers/CGAP%20BN7%20How%20generous%20is%20the%20UK.pdf)); I don’t really have a view on the other three questions.

The FME and the replacement effect both imply that all four questions are basically irrelevant to EAs, though.

People who claim they know their government is cutting the most important thing should be warey of their biases. But the burden of proof is not on them; you need to show that the government *does* cut the least important things first. In this case, Politics is the Mind Killer affects you; you should reduce your confidence that the government acts rationally and altruistically.

**re: NEF**

The NEF, in their analysis of bankers, assumed that *all* culpability for the economic crisis fell on bankers (rather than policymakers, or it being an endogenous shock), yet didn't take into account *any* of the benefits of finance - raising capital for firms, reducing risk through hedging, etc. The NEF are not, in general, credible economists.

The first google hit for "banking value added", http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/7400#fn , gives a much better surview of some of the literature. I'm concerned if 80k's research in this area involved reading NEF reports before googling "banking value added".

**re: politics**

There's a world of difference between starting a post with "In this post, I'll argue that *even if* you believed banks did net harm, this shouldn't affect your decision making much" and blithely suggesting that this is relevant to "any effective altruist". Nor does it justify the continued use of negative language.

‘People who claim they know their government is cutting the most important thing should be warey of their biases. But the burden of proof is not on them; you need to show that the government does cut the least important things first. In this case, Politics is the Mind Killer affects you; you should reduce your confidence that the government acts rationally and altruistically.’

I’m assuming you’re (something along the lines of) a Bayesian? In which case I don’t really know what place the burden of proof concept is supposed to have in such a worldview – one ‘simply’ takes all relevant data and updates their belief with them, granting arguments weight according to their persuasiveness. So if you don’t find the FME convincing, or if you have reliable data showing it doesn’t apply in full, you simply discount it accordingly.

To be clear – I’m certainly not claiming that the FME is a replacement for perfect knowledge of what deleterious effects on the economy will be, only that for those of us who lack such knowledge (which I would argue is all of us), it’s a useful approach that grants us some possibility of comparing economic harm vs the gain of pro-phil. Perhaps I should have called it the flat margin tendency.

The argument doesn’t rest on the government being rational and altruistic – if they were perfectly so, the FME would be irrelevant to the money that went to them, since then they’d be doing the same (or more) good with their money as you would be with yours. It rests a) on them being at least irrational enough that you can do better with money than you expect them to, and b) on the manner in which they’re irrational being difficult to predict. I think we agree on a), and your point about foreign aid is well taken as a criticism of b), but unless you think 100% of the harm you do will reliably come from the foreign aid budget and that the foreign aid budget is at least as cost-effective as you, the FME still applies to a slightly reduced extent; partly because money taken from other departments will be taken from those which the govt views as least efficient, partly because the departments it’s taken from will take it from the sub-fields _they_ view as least efficient, and partly because c67% of any lost money will be lost by individuals rather than government, who are (as a group) reliably nowhere near as altruistic as you. 

**re: NEF**

‘I’m concerned if 80k’s research in this area involved reading NEF reports before googling “banking value added”.’

Before anything else, I’d like to point out that I’m not an 80K researcher, nor is everything that appears on the blog sanctioned by the 80K research team (which, at the time of writing, consists solely a probably overworked Carl Shulman). It’s a venue for proposing and discussing ideas of interest to the effective altruism community.

As for the NEF, it was an example on which to test the effects of the FME, not a part of the argument for the latter. Perhaps I should have looked further into alternative views, but my main reason for not having done so was just that it didn’t really matter. I have subsequently done a little more searching, and still haven’t found anyone else who a) claims banks are detrimental to the economy and b) tries to quantify the amount to which they are – anyone who doesn’t do both is of no relevance, since I’m basically making an argument _for_ going into banking (or at least for increasing the value we think doing so has). Accepting the sources you’re recommending would only be preaching to the choir.

I think, as Eliezer is fond of pointing out, your knowledge of biases can harm you if you use them only to attack the views of others.  Politics is the Mind Killer doesn't mean you get to ignore the views of those who think that the government doesn't behave in accordance with Marginal Utility Theory. It shouldn't change your *mean* estimate for how inefficiently the government chooses which items to drop - just increase your variance.

This is especially important in this case, because foriegn aid - possibly the best part of the budget - is also a quite vulnerable target - perhaps not under the coalition, but under future governments.

On a different note, can we stop with the absurd banker-bashing? I realise you never explicitly say "bankers are harmful", but it's hard not to walk away with this impression. For example, 

"Now I’ll disrupt this rosy picture by introducing a destructive banker"

doesn't actually imply that any bankers *are* destructive - but if we substituted "banker" with a protected minority group, the result is so painful we'd never publish it.

Linking to the absurd New Economics Foundation doesn't help. 80k already has a "far-out" message - we should stick to sound mainstream economics, rather than endorcing the Iron Law of Wages.

Note: none of these are the opinions of 80k

There's lots of reasons. The main one is that in the lead up the financial crisis, bankers took on large amounts of leverage in search of short term profits and sold products without making their risks clear (sometimes in activities that were borderline illegal). The combination lead to a very unstable financial system, resulting in the financial crisis, leading to the recession. I think the NEF estimate is based on assuming that some significant fraction of the costs of the financial crisis was due to bankers.

Of course, there were lots of other reasons for the financial crisis e.g. central bank low interest rate policies, the housing bubble, chinese monetary policy, etc. It's controversial how much is due to bankers. 

What really angers people is that the bankers who made these bad decisions didn't financially suffer. The accusation is that they manipulated the system to their advantage. Indeed, the financial lobby seems to have quite a bit of influence over congress.

More socialist minded people would say that (financial crisis aside) bankers fundamentally exploit people, and act to prevent social reform that would remove this exploitation.

------------------------------------



People often talk about how you should just “go with your gut” when choosing a career. But how useful is this advice, really?

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/99/original/gut-feeling-gambling.jpg?1361790241'><img alt="Gut-feeling-gambling" class="image medium" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/99/medium/gut-feeling-gambling.jpg?1361790241" /></a>

In some earlier posts, I talked about ways in which [our intuitions can be misleading](http://80000hours.org/blog/109-should-we-stop-interviewing-people). I suggested that in fact, [a simple formula might often do a better job](http://80000hours.org/blog/117-a-formula-for-the-perfect-job). But I also acknowledged that there are specific circumstances in which [gut judgements can come in pretty handy](http://80000hours.org/blog/121-triumphs-of-intuition), namely when:

1. The environment in which we’re making decisions is sufficiently *predictable*
2. We have enough *experience* making similar decisions in similar environments
3. We’ve had good *feedback* on past decisions

What does all this mean for career choice? I’ll go into more detail on these points below, but the key takeaways are:

* **In general, we should be wary of our intuitions about careers**, especially when it comes to the big questions like “Which career is right for me?” and “Which career can I have the biggest impact in?”

* **However, this doesn’t mean intuitions have no part to play in career choice.** There might be some more specific decisions relevant to career choice that fit the above criteria, where our gut judgements are more likely to be trustworthy. Judgements in areas where we have a lot of experience ourselves, or where we can learn from the experience of others, for example, are more likely to be accurate.

* **It’s worth double-checking our intuitions career choice.** There are two steps to this:
1. Ask whether your judgement is likely to be accurate: can you tick the three criteria above?
2. Check your judgement against other sources of evidence: get more information about a career path through work experience and talking to people, and try using a more systematic approach such as a decision rule or formula.

##Why you should be wary of gut judgements in career choice


To make good career decisions, you need to know how much weight to give your intuitions. As there’s a fair amount of research on the nature and trustworthiness of intuitive judgements in general, we decided this was worth looking into. The common thread that emerges in the literature is that gut judgements are most useful when three factors are present: experience, predictability (of the environment), and feedback. Applying these findings to what we know about career choice, we believe there’s good reason to be wary of what our intuitions tell us when making career decisions for the following reasons:

1) **Lack of experience**: We don’t have a great deal of experience making career decisions, at least not as individuals, and not at making “big” decisions about long-term career goals; what we’ll ultimately enjoy, or what will allow us to have the most impact. These are the kinds of decisions we make once or twice a lifetime.

2) **Lack of predictability:** The world in which we’re making our career decisions is constantly changing, so it’s not all that easy to predict what’s going to happen. The job market today looks very different today from how it did ten years ago, and will undoubtedly have changed a great deal in another ten years’ time. Your own preferences and skills will also change and develop as you learn more. This means there’s probably a limit to how useful your intuitions, based on past experience, will be for making judgements about the future.

3) **Lack of feedback:** Feedback on career decisions is often slow. When we choose to take a particular job, or to head down a certain career path, it can be months if not years until we get any indication of whether the decision was a good one or not.

How strong is the evidence for these claims? We’ve surveyed a large body of research looking at when intuitions work for us, when they don’t, and why. Using meta-analyses rather than single studies where at all possible, we then asked whether these findings generalise to career choice from the kinds of cases studies. Given the extent of research and range of different situations in which intuitions have been studied, it seems likely that the general findings are robust enough to apply to the domain of career choice. However, as we didn’t find any research looking at the role of intuitions in career choice *directly*, there is an inference being made here, and in that respect the evidence could be stronger. It might also be true that intuitions help with some more specific decisions relevant to career choice, which I’ll discuss in more detail in the next section.

A final important consideration is that gut judgements seem to be at their most valuable when time is limited and being more thorough is impractical. Career choice doesn’t seem to be such a situation: it’s a decision worth taking some time over. This means there’s little to lose in double checking our intuitions by getting more evidence.

##When might intuitions be useful in career choice?


Career choice is perhaps better thought of as a sequence of many small, related decisions, rather than this one insurmountable decision of “What’s the ‘right’ career for me?” In practice, this needs breaking down into smaller questions that can be tackled more easily, questions like “Which of my next possible options allows me to best develop the skills and experience I need to further myself towards my goals?” These questions, in turn, need breaking down yet further: “Will I get on with the people I’m working with in this job?”, “Will this working environment help me to work productively?”, and so on. It seems plausible that we might sometimes have enough experience and/or wisdom from others for our intuitions to be useful in making some of these lower-level decisions.

There are certainly factors relevant to career choice which we might be able to make good gut judgements on. For example, we tend to be pretty good at judging what kinds of people we’ll get on with. We’re interacting with people on a daily basis and get good feedback on which interactions work best from each one. So if your “gut” tells you that a job’s not for you because you have a strong feeling you won’t get on with your boss, then it’s probably worth listening to. Similarly, your intuitions about what kind of work you’ll enjoy or be good at may be pretty trustworthy if you’ve spent a lot of time doing very similar work in the past. If you’ve spent the last three summers doing internships in different accounting firms, your “gut feeling” that you won’t enjoy working at another, similar, firm, should probably carry some weight. 

Finally, whilst we’re inexperienced as individuals, people collectively have been making career decisions for centuries, and received good feedback on what works over time. This suggests that *some* gut judgements, if based on received wisdom or by looking at patterns of success in the past, may be worth listening to. Exercise caution here, though: recall my earlier point that the job market is changing rapidly, so some of what was useful for making career decisions in the past may no longer be so helpful.

In November of 2012 I set a goal for myself: find the most x-risk reducing role I can fill. At first I thought it would be by working directly with MIRI, but after a while it became clear that I could contribute more by simply donating. So my goal became: find the highest paying job, so I can donate lots of money to CFAR and MIRI.

A little bit of background on me. Started programming in 2000. Graduated in 2009 with Bachelor's in computer science. Worked for about a year and a half at a game company. Then did my own game startup for about a year. Then moved to the Bay Area and joined a game startup here, which was acquired 10 months later. Worked a bit at the new company and then left. So, just under four years of professional programming experience, but primarily in the game industry. Almost no leadership / managerial experience, aside from the startup I did where I hired freelancers.

Below is my experience of finding a software engineering job in the Silicon Valley. If you are not an engineer or not in the Silicon Valley, I think you'll still find a lot of useful information here.

 
##Pre-game

Before sending out my resume, I spent about a month preparing. I read [Intro to Algorithms](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262033844/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1367534120&sr=8-1&keywords=intro%20to%20algorithms&tag=vglnk-c319-20), which was very good overall, but not a huge help in preparing for interviews.[^1] I read [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1367534155&sr=1-1&keywords=cracking%20the%20coding%20interview&tag=vglnk-c319-20), which was extremely helpful. (If you read only one book to prepare, make it this one.) The book has a lot of questions that are similar to the ones you'll actually see during interviews. I also did TopCoder problems, which were pretty helpful as well.[^2] Looking back, I wish I spent more time finding actual interview questions online and doing more of those (that's why CCI book was so helpful).

After several weeks of preparation, I compiled a long list of companies I was going to apply to. I checked on [GlassDoor](http://www.glassdoor.co.uk/index.htm) to see what kind of salary I could expect at each one. I then rated all the companies. Companies with low salaries and poor personal fit received the lowest rating.

I started by applying to companies with the lowest ratings. This way I could use them as practice for the companies I thought would actually make a competitive offer. This was the right move and worked very well. (Another friend of mine did the same approach with good results as well.) Remember, you are not just doing those interviews to practice the coding problems, you are practicing pitching yourself as well.

 

##Interviewing with a company

Standard procedure for applying to a tech company:

1) Send them your resume.

* Proofread your resume. Let your friends proofread it.
* Make sure there are only relevant things on it. When I applied to tech companies, I removed a lot of game-specific things from my resume. * When I applied to companies that did 3D graphics, I made sure I had all my 3D graphics experience listed. I ended up with two version of my resume.
* Have your resume in DOC, PDF, and TXT formats. This way you'll always have the right one when you upload / paste it.
* For a few companies, I had a friend or friend of a friend who referred me. This *really helps* in two ways: 1) your resume will be processed a lot faster, 2) if your friend is a great engineer/employee, you'll be taken a lot more seriously, and the company will fight for you a lot harder.

2) You'll get an email from the recruiter and setup a time to speak, where you'll talk about yourself, what you've done, why you are interested in their company, and so on. You can and should ask them questions as well.
* When you start getting multiple calls each day, make sure you know who is calling. There is nothing worse than talking about the challenges of streaming music to a car sharing startup. (True story.)
* Read about the company on Wikipedia before the call. Know the basic stuff. Look at their website and read the About page.
Find the thing that makes the company special and successful. Find the thing that you actually think is cool about the company. Those are your answers for why you want to work there.
* Ask non-technical questions: How is the company structured? How many teams are there? How many employees? Engineers? Think of other intelligent questions to ask.
* In my experience, it's not very beneficial to tell them you are interviewing with a dozen other companies. When they ask who else you are interviewing with, just name a few companies, especially the competitors / similar companies.
* Be *super nice* to your recruiter. They are your main point of contact with the company. They'll be the one fighting to get you the best offer.

3) You'll have a technical phone interview with a software engineer where you'll solve a problem or two on [collabedit](http://collabedit.com/) or some similar website. At the end, you'll get a few minutes to ask them questions too.
* All the usual interviewing tips apply here. E.g. talk out loud, your interviewer doesn't know what you are thinking.
* Most companies don't care what language you use, as long as it's mainstream. (I used C# for almost all my coding questions.)
* DO NOT start answering the question by writing code. If the questions seems vague, ask about the context. Who'll be using this solution? Definitely ask about the kind of data you are working with. If it's integers, are they random? Over some small range or over all possible integers?
* List out metrics for various approaches: brute-force solution, optimized for speed solution, optimized for memory solution. Here is a question I saw a few times: Write a data structure which can accept and store integers, and can check if there exist two integers that sum up to a given number. There are multiple solutions, and the best one depends on the ratio of addInteger to checkForSum calls.
* The previous steps should only take you a minute or two. Once you've decided what the best approach is, then you can write the solution.
* When you are done, check for errors, then run through several examples. Do a simple example and a slightly complicated example. When you find a bug, don't be hasty in fixing it. Understand why it happened and make sure you won't introduce new bugs by fixing it.
* If everything works, make sure you handle errors correctly. Can you handle invalid input? Input that violates your assumptions? (As a reminder, I leave “\\Check for errors” comments in appropriate spots as I code the solution.)
* When you are done, ask the interviewer questions. Ask them to tell you about what they do, if they haven't already. What have they been working on recently? What technologies/languages do they use at the company? Do they use Scrum/Agile? Pair-programming? Come up with other intelligent questions to ask.
 

4) You'll be invited for an on-site interview which will be 3-6 hours long, at least half of which will be coding on a white-board. (Although, a friend told me he brought his laptop with him, and most people were fine with him coding on it.)

All the previous tips apply.
* Be on time. Take bathroom breaks when you need them. I found that drinking water during the interview keeps me refreshed. Remember your posture, body-language, and eye-contact skills.
* Learn how to talk out loud as you are writing out your solution. If you are stuck, explain what you are thinking, and what your intuition is telling you.
* Learn how to read your interviewers. If you say, "Here we should check for the null case or for empty array," and they go "Yeah, yeah, okay," they are not the type of interviewer that really cares about error conditions, so you can be somewhat more lax there. By the time I was finishing my on-site interviews, I could tell if my solution was right just by the interviewer's body language.
* When you are done, ask them questions. What are they working on? What's the thing they like most about the company? What's their least favorite thing about the company? (Another way to phrase that: What's one thing you would change if you could change anything about the company?) Do they have to work overtime? How are the people here? Can you switch between projects? Are there company wide events? * In all my interviews I've never met an interviewer that didn't try to sell their company really hard. People will always tell you their company is the best place to work.
* If the person is a manager or a director, ask them higher level questions. What kind of culture are they trying to create? What are the current big challenges? Where do they want the company to be in the next 5 years? How does one advance in the company? (Usually there is a managerial and a technical track.) How often are reviews done? How are they structured?
 

5) You'll get a call from the recruiter congratulating you on an offer. They'll go over the offer details with you.

* Before they make you an offer, they'll check if you are actually seriously considering their company. If you told a startup you are also interviewing with Google, they might suspect that you are not seriously considering them. Unless you dissuade those fears, they might actually not even make you an offer. (Happened to me with Rdio.)
* If you didn't get an offer, try to get as much info as you can. What happened? What can you improve on? Below are the reasons why I didn't get an offer after an on-site interview: a) Not doing well on a technical question. (Happened twice; one time because of a very obnoxious interviewer.); b) Not interviewing for quite the right position (that on-site interview ended early); c) Not having the necessary experience (a lot more important to startups than bigger companies); d) Not being passionate enough about the company.
* If this is not a good timing for the offer, e.g. it's one of your first interviews, then tell them so. They will probably wait to give you the offer details until you are ready to consider it.
* The recruiter will likely ask what's important to you in an offer. How are you going to make your decision? What I've said is that compensation will be an important factor in my decision, but that the team/project/etc. are important considerations as well.
 

6) You have a few days (usually around 5 business days) until the offer expires to decide if you want to accept it.

* Sometimes the offer will expire before you've received offers from other companies. This is why it's important to interview in rough order of ranking, so that you can just let those offers go, knowing you'll have much better ones soon. If you want to hold on to the offer, just ask your recruiter for an extension. It'll be much easier to get an extension at big companies, especially if you are interviewing for a generic position.
* If you decline the offer, let them know.
 

Always be very nice, friendly, and polite. Walk the fine line between telling the truth and saying the right thing. Ideally, make sure those are the same. Even if you are interviewing with a company you have no intention of working at, make sure to find something you really like about them, something that makes them stand out to you. Always have a good answer to: "Why do you want to work here?"

Before each on-site interview make sure you research the company thoroughly. Use their product. Think of ways to improve it. It's very helpful if you can meet with someone that works there and talk to them. See if they can give you any tips on the interview process. Some companies (e.g. AirBnB) want people that are extremely passionate about their product. Some companies focus more than usual on architectural questions. Many companies expect the engineers to have some familiarity with UI/UX and the ability to think about a feature from all angles.

 

##Managing your time

I sent my resume to 78 companies, had at least a phone conversation with a recruiter with 27 of them, had an on-site interview with 16 companies, and received 12 offers. Out of those, I've only seriously considered 3. (Companies with lower ratings had an atrocious response rate.)

My time-line ended up looking something like this:

* Week 1: Started applying to low-rated companies. About 2 phone interviews.
* Week 2: About 7 phone interviews. One on-site interview. Sending out more resumes.
* Week 3: About 3 phone interviews.
* Week 4: About 15 phone interviews. A few meetings with friends of friends, who ended up referring me. 1 on-site interview. Sent my resume to all the high-rated companies. (During this week interviewing became a full-time job.)
* Week 5: About 10 phone interviews. 4 on-site interviews.
* Week 6: 8 phone interviews. 4 on-site interviews.
* Week 7: 4 phone calls. 5 on-site interviews.
* Week 8: 12 phone calls. 2 on-site interviews.
* Week 9: About 8 calls a day for a few days, while I negotiated with my top companies.
* (These are strictly lower bounds for phone calls. On-site data is pretty accurate.)

Some companies move fast, some companies move slow. Google took 2 weeks from the on-site interview to the offer call. This is very common for them, but most other companies move faster. With Amazon, I actually interviewed with two different branches. With one branch things were going well, until they dropped the ball and never got back to me, even after I pestered them. This is unusual; although, Twitter did something similar, but then ended up responding with an on-site invitation. With the other Amazon branch, when I got home from the on-site interview, I already had an email saying they were going to make an offer. This is extremely fast. (I had a very good reference for that position.) Most companies take about a week between on-site and offer. The whole process, from first call to offer, takes about three weeks.

If your recruiter doesn't respond to you during 4 days or longer, shoot them an email. They might have forgotten to respond, or thought they did, or may be things are moving slowly, or may be they decided not to pursue. You want to be clear on where you stand with all the companies you are applying to.

The timing is pretty important here. You want your top-rated companies to give you an offer within a span of a week. This way you'll be able to leverage all those offers against each other.

If your current job position is already almost optimal for your goals, then it's possible you can do a few interviews, get a few offers and pick the best one, which will give you some marginal improvement. Or use those offers to leverage a raise at your existing company. But if you are pretty sure your current job has not been optimized for your goal, then I'd say, contrary to popular wisdom, just leave and spend a full month interviewing. (Or, even better, if you can, take a long "vacation".) You just can't do this kind of intense interviewing while holding another job. The one exception to this rule I can think of is if one of your highest-rated companies is a competitor with your current employer. Then you can leverage that!

Value of information is extremely high during this process. Talk to all the companies you can, talk to all the people you can. Once you have the final list of companies you are considering, reduce your uncertainty on everything. Validate all your assumptions. (Example: I was sure Google matched donations up to $12k, but turns out it's only up to $6k.)

 

##How to evaluate your offer

There are 4 basic components in an offer: sign-on bonus, base salary, equity, and bonus.

**Sign-on bonus**. Most companies will be okay offering something like $12k sign-on bonus. Some will offer more. Most startups probably won't offer any.

**Base salary**. This is pretty consistent across most companies. Based on your experience, you'll be given a title (e.g. Senior Software Engineer or SE 2), and that title will determine the range of the salary you can expect. If you are good, you can demand a salary at the top of that range, but it's extremely hard to go higher.

**Equity**. This is the most interesting part. A good amount of value will come from this portion. With a startup, it'll be most of it. Here are two things to pay attention to:

* Is the company public or private? If it's public, you are most likely going to be given RSUs (restricted stock units), which will basically convert to normal company shares when they vest. For private companies, see the section below.
* What's the vesting schedule? For almost all companies you'll get 25% of your shares right after your first year. (This is called a 'cliff'.) After that you'll be given the appropriate fraction either monthly (e.g. at Google) or quarterly (e.g. at Facebook). Amazon is an example of a company where the vesting schedule is somewhat different: 5% after year 1, 15% after year 2, and then 20% each semester for the next two years.

**Bonus**. This is the bonus system the company has setup. You can't negotiate it, but it's important to take it into account.

* There will usually be a cash bonus that's based on your salary. It'll have a target percent (e.g. 15%). If you can find out how many people hit their target, that will be very helpful. However, most companies don't share or simply don't have that information.
* Some companies also have equity bonuses. Try to get as much info on those as you can. Don't assume that you'll get the maximum bonus even if you work hard. If you have friends working at that company, ask them what kind of bonuses they've been getting.
* Lots of startups don't have bonus systems in place.

**Other factors.**

* Donation matching: Google matches up to $6k (you donate $6k to any charity, they'll donate another $6k). Craigslist matches 3:1 up to 10% of your salary. Most companies don't have anything like that, and you can't negotiate it.
* Paid Time Off: Google offers 2 weeks, all other companies I was considering offer 3 weeks, and some even have unlimited PTO. This is not negotiable in most companies.
* Commute: how far will you have to travel to work? Are you okay moving closer to work? (Google and Facebook have shuttles that can pick you up almost anywhere, so you could work while you commute.)
* People/culture/community/team/project are all important factors as well, depending on what you want. If you are going to spend the next several years working on something, you should be building up skills that will still be valuable in the future.
 

##Thinking about private companies

If the company is private, you might be given RSUs or you might be given stock options. With stock options, you'll have to pay the strike price to exercise your options. So the total value your options have is: (price of a share - strike price) * number of shares.

You can't do anything with your shares until the company gets acquired or goes public. Some companies have liquidation events, but those are pretty rare. Most companies don't have them, and the ones that do only extend the opportunity to people that have been with the company for a while. There are also second-hand markets, but I don't know much about those.

If you are completely risk-intolerant, then just go with a public company, and don't consider private companies. (This is actually not exactly true. Just because a company is public, doesn't mean its risk-free, and just because a company is private doesn't mean there is a lot of risk. There are other important factors like the size of the company, their market diversity, and how long they've been around.) If you are okay with some risk, then you want a company that's close to an IPO or is likely to get acquired soon. If you want to have a chance to make more than a few million dollars, either start your own company or join a very early stage startup (my top pick would be [Ripple](https://ripple.com/)). Before doing so, check out the stats on startups to make sure you understand how likely any given startup is to fail and make sure you understand the concepts of inside/outside view.

 

##Taxes

It's crucial to understand all the tax implications of your salary, equity, and donations. I'm not going to go into all the details, there are a lot of resources out there for this, but you should definitely read them until it's crystal clear how you will be taxed. I'll highlight a few points:

* Understand the [tax rate schedule](http://taxes.about.com/od/Federal-Income-Taxes/qt/Tax-Rates-For-The-2013-Tax-Year.htm) and notice the new 39.6% tax bracket. If your income is $100k, that doesn't mean you get taxed 28% on all of it. 28% applies only to the income portion above $87,850. Also note that this is only the federal tax. Your state will have additional taxes as well. Aside from those percentages, there are a few other flat taxes, but they are considerably smaller in magnitude.
* The money you donate to a nonprofit (aka. 501(c)(3)) organization can be subtracted from your taxable income. This means that you will most likely get a refund when you file your taxes. Why? Because when you fill out your W4 form, you'll basically tell your employer how much money to withhold from your paycheck for tax purposes. If you don't account for your future donations, more money will be withheld than is appropriate and the discrepancy will be paid back to you after you file your taxes. Ideally, you want to take your donations into account and fill out the W4 form such that there are no discrepancies. That means you'll get your money now rather than later. (I haven't gone through this process myself, so there is some uncertainty here.)
* You can claim tax deduction for up to 50% of your wages. That means if you make a lot of money in one year, even if you donate most of it, you'll be able to reduce your taxable income by a maximum of 50%. The rest goes over to the next year.
When RSUs vest, their value is treated as ordinary income for tax purposes. When you sell them, the difference is taxed as a capital gain (or loss).
* Stock options have a more complicated set of tax rules, and you should understand them if you are considering a company that offers them.
* You can't have your employer donate money or stock for you to bypass the taxes. I've asked.
 

##Calculating donations

To calculate exactly how much I could donate if I worked at a given company, I've created [this spreadsheet](http://api.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=9f37ca02a1e3cbd4f3d0a3618a39fbca&loc=http%3A%2F%2Flesswrong.com%2Flw%2Fhd1%2Fmaximizing_your_donations_via_a_job%2F&v=1&libId=a3837163-eb0b-4cfd-bc6f-b947667caf40&out=https%3A%2F%2Fdl.dropboxusercontent.com%2Fu%2F30954211%2FSalariesExample.xls&title=Maximizing%20Your%20Donations%20via%20a%20Job%20-%20Less%20Wrong&txt=this%20spreadsheet&jsonp=vglnk_jsonp_137216806492714). (This is an example with completely fictitious company offers with very low numbers, but the calculations should be correct.) Let me walk you through the spreadsheet.

 

**Time discounting (Cell B1)**

Money now is more valuable than money later. By how much? That's a very complicated question. If you invest your money now, you might be able to make something like 10% annually with some risk.[^3] If you are donating to a charity, and they are growing very rapidly, then they can do a lot with your money right now, and you should account for that as well. If you expect the charity to double in size/effectiveness/output in the next year, then you might use a discount rate as high as 50%. I chose to use 20% annual discount rate based on my own estimates. Since I'm doing monthly compounding, the spreadsheet value is slightly higher (~22%). You can look at the column K to see how the future value of a dollar is being discounted. Note, for example, that a dollar in 12 months is worth 80¢ to me now. This discounting rate is especially important to keep in mind when examining startups, because almost all their compensation lies in the future. The further away it is, the more heavily you have to discount it.

 

**Cost of living (Cell B2)**

This is how much pre-tax money a year I'm not going to donate. See column L for the monthly expenses. We time-discount those dollars as well.

 

**Offers (Cells A4-I15)**

This is where you plug-in the offers you get. Bonus row is for cash bonus. Equity row is for the total equity the company offers you. I use the dollar amount, but you'll notice that for some of them I'm computing the dollar amount as: RSUs the company is giving me * current share price. For private companies, this is value I expect my equity to have when the company goes public. For Square it looks like: (percent of the company I'll own) * (my guess at valuation of the company at IPO) - (cost to exercise my options). For Twitter it looks like: (growth factor up to IPO) * (current price per share) * (RSUs I am granted). (Again, the numbers are completely made up.) In my calculations I'm not expecting public companies' share price to rise or fall. If you disagree, you should adjust for that as well.

 

**Monthly projections (Cells A18-I66)**

We are going to look at how much money we'll be making per month for the next four years. (Four years because our equity should be fully vested by that time.) If you are certain that you will stay at the company for less time than that, then you should consider a shorter timeline. This might affect companies differently. For example, most of the equity you get at Amazon comes during the last two years. If you are not going to be there, you are missing out on a big part of your offer.

For companies that I was seriously considering, I created two columns: one for cash wages and one for equity wages. This way I can do taxes on them more precisely.

Let's go through the Google's offer:

* For the first year we'll be only making our standard salary.

* After the first year, we get our cash bonus (green font). Here we are assuming it'll be 15% of our salary. We also get 25% of our RSUs vested (salmon background).

* For the remainder of the second year, we are making our normal salary. Each month we also get 1/48th of our original equity offer.

* Google also has an equity bonus system, where each year you can get a bonus of up to 50% of your original equity offer. This bonus will be paid in RSUs, and it vests over 4 years, but with no cliff. So we count that as well, but I'm assuming I'm only going to get 15%, not the full 50%.

* In year 3 everything is basically the same, except now we got our second equity bonus, so we have two of them running simultaneously.

* In year 4, we have three of them running simultaneously.

For pre-IPO companies, I've estimated when they'll go IPO. Most have clauses in place that don't allow you to sell your shares until after half a year or so after the IPO. I'm assuming I will sell/donate all my shares then, and then continue selling/donating them as they continue vesting.

 

**Sum (Cells A68-I71)**

In row 68 we have the total sum. This is the amount of pre-tax dollars we expect to earn in the next four years (remember that this amount has been adjusted for time-discounting, so it'll seem much lower than you'd normally expect). L68 is how much money we are spending on ourselves during those four years.

In row 69 we subtract our living expenses to get the amount of money we'll be able to donate. Note that I'm subtracting it from the cash column, leaving the equity column alone (for the companies where I split the two).

In row 70 we account for taxes. Note that our living expenses already accounted for the taxes we pay up to $65k, so the rest of it will be taxed at around 28% or higher. You could sell your shares, or you could just donate your shares directly to your charity. (That's what we are doing with our Google offer.)

In row 71 we simply sum up the donations from cash and equity.

 

Disclaimer 1: while I tried as hard as I could to double check this spreadsheet, there might still be mistakes there, so use it with caution and triple check everything. The tax calculations as they are right now are wrong, and you'll have to redo them (basically the whole Row 70) based on your own numbers.

Disclaimer 2: this spreadsheet is not great for evaluating an offer from a startup, since it doesn't capture the associated uncertainty and risk. Furthermore, if you expect the startup to succeed after more than 4 years, to correctly compare it to other companies you'll have to compute more than 48 months and potentially start accounting for things like promotions and raises.

 

##Picking the one

All right, so how do you actually pick the best company? It's not as simple as picking the one with the highest EV, since you have to account for risk involved with startups and even pre-IPO companies. In fact, you should be surprised if your offers from public companies have a higher EV than offers from startups. If that's the case, I'd double check your calculations.

This is where it becomes extremely crucial to narrow down your uncertainty. When is the company going to IPO? What is the likely valuation? Does the company have a lot of competitors? Does the company have the necessary talent to execute on their plan? What's the company's history? What is the employee churn rate (especially for executives)? How well is the company doing financially? Who are the investors? Etc, etc, etc... There is a ton of questions you should be asking, and you should be asking them to everyone whose opinion on this issue you can respect. Honest opinion from an informed and knowledgeable neutral party is worth a LOT here!

You should also talk to the people at the company. Your recruiter will connect you to the right people if you ask. Keep in mind that nobody there will tell you that the company is going to go bankrupt or fail. But you can still get some valuable estimates, and then potentially discount them down a bit. You can even ask for their opinion on other companies you are interviewing with. Expect them to completely throw the other company under the bus though, but even so, you could get a lot of valuable criticism and bring it up when you talk to that other company. Overall, expect a lot of conflicting messages.

Keep in mind the charities you'll be donating to. What kind of donors do they have already? Are most people donating a bit from their salary? In that case, a more risky venture might be reasonable. Can they really use some money right now, or would they be a lot more effective later on with a large capital? What's their time discount rate? If you care about your charity, you can help them diversify their donor pool.

For me, it was a hard choice between big public companies (primary candidate: Google) and close to IPO companies (primary candidates: Twitter and Square).

 

##Negotiating

You have to negotiate your offer. You have to *have to* **have to** HAVE TO. For any given company, you'll be able to get them to up their offer at least once and potentially thrice. Example: Google upped my offer three times.

* Some companies will tell you their offer is not negotiable. That's not true.
* It's much easier to leverage similar companies against each other. Leverage big public companies against each other; leverage pre-IPO companies against each other; etc... Leveraging between those categories is a bit more difficult, because startups know they can't compete with the raw cash value you are offered at bigger companies. The only thing they can do is up their equity offer and hope that they are a much better personal fit for you than the large companies.
* Recruiters will ask you very directly what the other companies are offering you. You can choose to disclose or not to disclose. If you don't disclose, the company will come back to you with their standard offer. That offer might be higher or lower than you expected. (Example: The first offer I got from Google was significantly worse than initial offers I got from Facebook and Amazon.) If you tell them what offers you have (and you should only disclose details of your very best offers), then they'll very likely match or come in a bit stronger. Usually you don't have much to gain by disclosing your other offers upfront. You can always do so later. However, you should let your recruiters know that other companies did make an offer, or you are expecting them to. That gives you more leveraging power.
* Sign-on bonus is very easy to negotiate. You can easily convince a company to match a sign-on bonus their competitor has offered.
* Negotiating salary is much harder, but, again, usually you can convince a company to match a salary their competitor has offered or at least come closer to it. If you are interviewing with startups, their salary offer will usually be lower than at bigger companies and even harder to negotiate. ("Cash is king" is the common phrase used there.)

**First negotiating phase**: simply email / call back your recruiter (who is now your best friend, right?) and tell them that the offer is somewhat lower than you expected, you have other better offers from other companies, and you are wondering if they can increase their offer. If the company made you a clearly worse offer than another similar company, you should be very open about it.

**Second negotiating phase**: matching other companies. This is when it makes the most sense to disclose your other offers. For example, I used my Amazon and Facebook offers to convince Google to up their offer significantly. For some reason their original offer was very low, but seeing their competitors with much better offers convinced them to update pretty quickly. You can also bring up the perks one company has that the other doesn't (e.g. donation matching or unlimited PTO). The company can make up for that with salary/equity. There is some difficulty in using offers from private companies as leverage, because there is not much information you can disclose about them. You can talk about the number of shares you'll have, but it might not mean anything to the other recruiters if they are not familiar with the startup.

**Third negotiating phase**: once you picked the company you'll work for, go back to them and say something along the lines of "I really like the offer and the company, but there are a few things that don't make it ideal for me. One of your competitors did this, and another company has that. Right now I'm inclined to go with your competitor, but it's a tough decision, and I would rather go with you. I think if you can make me an offer with the following parameters, it'll make my decision extremely easy, and I'll sign on the spot." Include offer letters from other companies, especially the ones that have them beat or beat on some parameters. Notice the key promise at the end: you will sign with them. Your recruiter will have a lot more leverage in fighting for you if you make that promise. You are not legally obligated to follow through with your promise, but I wouldn't advise breaking it or using it just to extract more value to use as leverage against other companies. Use this tactic at the very end to extract that last bit of value from the company that's already the best. This is what I did with Google. I asked for about 3% higher salary and 12% more equity than what they were offering, and they came back with the exact numbers I requested, which means I should have asked for more. My advice would be to ask for about twice or may be even three times as much (6% and 30% respectively). Even if they come back with a compromise, it'll very likely be more than 3% and 12% increase. If not, you can try to barter one more time.

I'm sure some people will cringe at this kind of haggling, but, in all honesty, this is what recruiters expect, and they are very much used to it. Nobody even blinked an eye when I started negotiating, even on second and third rounds. However, some recruiters might try to make you feel guilty. They'll say that if you really want to work at their startup, then you shouldn't really care about your compensation. Most points they'll make will even be valid, but if you are trying to optimize for donations, then you have to make the compensation the most important factor in your decision. I've actually told most of my recruiters that I plan to donate most of my salary to charities. I don't think that got me higher offers, but it made me come off less like a greedy jerk.

At the end of the day, the company wants you, but they want to pay you as little as possible. *But*, given the choice of having you and paying you the most you deserve VS. not having you, all companies will pick the first option. ALL OF THEM. This is one of the best perks of being a talented software engineer in the Bay Area.

Once you accept the offer, don't forget to email everyone else and let them know. Thank everyone that helped you. Some recruiters will be surprised by your decision, and some will even fight really hard to get you to reconsider.

Somalia is in crisis. For decades it has been racked by civil war, famine, and political violence. Members of 80,000 Hours who want to help the people of Somalia will most likely explore various ways they can help and assess them quantitatively. Is it obvious that quantitative methods provide the correct tools to deal with a crisis like this? Or instead can quantification limit the kinds of possible interventions we think about, blinding us to significant long term solutions?

Rationality does not tell us what to value. But once we have decided what our ultimate goals are it can tell us what paths to those goals will be most effective. The problem is that often the goal we have in mind is rather fuzzy and intuitive. The methods of analysis used to decide on a course of action do not always work as expected, which can produce unwanted results.

We can break goals down by how easily they are converted into quantitative terms:

* **Inherently quantitative goals:** These are those that are explicitly in the form 'maximise numerical quantity X'. Examples might be 'get more money', or 'get as many people as possible to join my organisation.'
* **Optionally quantifiable goals:** These are goals that can be measured approximately/with difficulty/with some loss of completeness. For instance “improve health” can be replaced by the numerical goal 'increase years of healthy life, or more precisely [QALYs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year)', but this will sometimes not completely match how we intuitively regard health.
* **Non-quantifiable goals:** These are goals that, in practice or in principle cannot be reduced to numerical terms. For instance “produce the greatest work of art” might be assumed to be in principle not measurable. However “promote human rights” might be a large collection of ideas each of which might be in principle measurable, but are collectively incommensurate (how many censored books is worth one use of torture?)

Goals of the first kind are very well understood, the method is simple. Do research, find out what actions increase the quantity you’re trying to increase, do those things. But this method does not obviously give the best advice for the other two classes of goals. The questions then are when we should use quantitative methods and when we should rely on an intuitive or qualitative approach.

Non-quantifiable goals are certainly not dealt with well by scientific/rational study. Detailed and evidenced based [tutorials](http://lesswrong.com/lw/8f2/drawing_less_wrong_an_introduction/) on limited technical skills like accurate drawing exist. But there is little on art generally. This seems unlikely to change in the short term. Without a clear way of judging success most analytical methods struggle. (1)

The most interesting category is the “optionally quantifiable goals”. Here we have some way to approximately measure how well we are doing, but understand that this is not an exact measure. There may be situations that we measure as being better that are in fact less like what we want. There are several biases that might make a quantitative approach less effective than anticipated.

The question then for someone whose goal is to help Somalia is how to approach this task to greatest benefit. We might seek to increase QALYs, we might seek to increase some objective measure of stability, we might seek to increase Somali GDP. Whichever measure we choose there are some dangers we might run into.

**The Dangers of Quantification**

[**Goodhart’s/Campbell's law**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law). The use of any measure as the basis of policy often destroys the effectiveness of that measure to record the thing we are interested in. Goodhart’s original observation was that the correlations that justified monetarism no longer held when the market changed its behaviour in response to a monetarist government. In general we can expect that very large effects will change the world in ways that measures devised before the change will not completely capture. When intervening in Somalia we might include promoting one party over another in our measure of success, this would corrupt the supported party and result in negative consequences.

[**The McNamara fallacy**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNamara_fallacy). By measuring one aspect of a problem we tend to forget the importance of all other aspects of the problem. According to legend, Soviet planners once rewarded factories based on the number of nails produced. In response factories made millions of tiny nails of no use to anyone. The planners responded by rewarding the weight of metal used, resulting in a handful of giant nails being made. The story is funny but the point is serious: if we measure our good in Somalia by QALYs (years of healthy life) then we are likely to decide that the government bankrupting itself to pay for food to relieve a famine would be a good thing. This is not obviously how we would actually want things to pan out.

The **“I need more data”** fallacy. It is very hard to get enough information to come to a definitive conclusion. Quantitative methods make this lack very obvious. It is much easier to be convinced by a qualitative argument than to be satisfied that some statistical analysis is actually complete. For this reason it is easy for one who analyses the world quantitatively to introduce a bias to spend too long trying to improve their error bars and not on acting. If you think two cures will both save about a thousand QALYs per year to within 10 percent you might want to spend a month finding out which one outperforms the other. Half the time you will gain 100 QALYs like this, but all the time you will lose the 83 QALYs you could have saved the first month.

Restricting the domain of considered options. Some ways of helping (funding food aid, vaccination, sanitation) are very easy to understand quantitatively and very well researched. Others (lobbying the UN, leading a socialist coup, becoming the new President of Somalia’s PA) are much much harder to analyse. When faced with the choice between an intervention that is known to save 1000 ±10 lives and an intervention whose effectiveness is wildly uncertain, (say believed to save 1100 ±1000 lives) it is easy to bias your decisions towards the understood interventions. And that is if the possibility occurs to you at all. Despite spending quite some time considering third world interventions I hadn’t even considered staging a socialist coup until I deliberately tried to come up with strange examples.

**Conclusion**

There are many ways that a quantitative approach can lead us astray.

We can be misled into doing things that merely suit the numbers and which aren’t in fact what we want to see. This is dangerous if we empower agents to act on our behalf knowing only about the quantified goal. If we do empower agents to do anything that isn’t in the “inherently quantifiable” category it is important to put safeguards on them. Likewise it’s important to put safeguards on ourselves; running [sanity checks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanity_testing) every now and again is important. You need to make sure that neither you nor your agents is going to end up sending large shipments of pork to Somalia, no matter how much that might be the right way to solve a famine.

But once this is done, the more important question remains. Are we missing out on important interventions because we are afraid to use anything we have trouble quantifying? Next time I would like to argue that most of the time a quantitative approach, done correctly, will show us the best strategies. And that an alternative qualitative approach is not likely to do better on average.

But this isn’t always easy. Rather than encouraging constructive discussion, presenting new ideas - especially about moral issues - can often spark confrontation.

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/82/original/discussion.jpg?1359454471'><img alt="Discussion" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/82/large/discussion.jpg?1359454471" /></a>

I know a number of people have found this when talking about the fact they give x% of their income to charity. As soon as the idea is mentioned, rather than really listening, people often respond defensively; giving reasons why they don’t do the same or why your suggestion is totally unreasonable. “I can’t afford to save money/pay my mortgage and donate too”, “You must be getting financial support from elsewhere if you’re donating that much!”, and similar responses seem common. As soon as these kind of defensive reactions slip in, all hopes of getting your point across are pretty much shattered.

Why is it so hard to communicate new or controversial ideas without provoking confrontation? How can you improve the way you frame your case to encourage discussion, not defensiveness?

##What causes this defensive reaction?

The first thing to note is that we mostly have a strong desire, arguably a *need*, to believe that we are good, moral people.[^1] This means that if you present someone with a piece of information which seems to contradict that belief, they’re not going to like it very much. Feeling like their own positive self-image is being threatened, people often [tend to resent, rather than respect, moral behaviour in others](http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2011/08/why_moral_leade.html).[^2] This is down to a phenomenon known as [cognitive dissonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)[^3]: that feeling of discomfort you get when you realise the way you’re behaving contradicts a view you hold of yourself.[^4] When you express to someone the view that “morally you should do/care about x” and they *don’t* do x, you seem to be suggesting that their behaviour doesn’t square with their view of themselves as being moral. 

If your behaviour appears to conflict with a belief you have about yourself, there are three possible methods of resolution:

1) *Change your behaviour*

2) *Change your beliefs about yourself*

3) *Add new beliefs that justify your behaviour given your already existing beliefs about yourself*

You believe you're a pretty a sensible, health-conscious person. One day, despite a great deal of medical advice to the contrary, you get into the habit of smoking. This makes you feel quite uncomfortable: you really do believe you’re sensible and health conscious, but your smoking suggests the opposite. What can you do to resolve this?

1) *You could stop smoking*

2) *You could accept you’re not as health conscious as you thought you were, after all*

3) *Or, you could attempt to justify your smoking to make it consistent with you being health-conscious: it’s relaxing which has its own health benefits, the doctors have got it wrong, etc...*

Faced with this choice, a lot of people seem to go for the third option. This isn’t surprising. Changing your behaviour, especially if it means giving up something you enjoy, can be incredibly difficult. Accepting that you just don’t have the positive traits you thought you did isn’t that appealing either. Finding a way to justify your behaviour whilst retaining a positive self-image, therefore, might seem like the best of both worlds.

I think the reason people can be so defensive about moral issues is often similar to the reason people justify their bad habits. We (mostly) all believe we are good people. If someone points out that our behaviour doesn’t square with that we can either a) change our behaviour - start donating more to charity, for example - which might at first seem to be a big sacrifice, b) accept we’re not really a good person, or c) find some way to justify our behaviour. This is what people seem to be doing when they claim they can’t reasonably afford to give money or away, or try to find reasons why making such a suggestion is unreasonable, without necessarily giving it full consideration.

How can you communicate your cause to prevent this kind of reaction? There are two steps here that result in defensiveness: the unpleasant feeling of dissonance itself, and an attempt to resolve the conflict by justification. So there are two ways you might try to avoid confrontation: by communicating your ideas in a way that aims to minimise the dissonance caused to begin with, or by doing so in a way that encourages a different reaction to it.

##Preventing the conflict

The first tactic would be to try and prevent the reaction altogether, by framing your case in a way that appears consistent with what the person you’re speaking to already believes. If someone feels they can consider your view without compromising their view of themselves as a “good” person, they’re much more likely to fully listen to what you’re saying. 

*What to say*: 

“Most people want to do good, but just haven’t been told some of the most important facts: like doing x can make a really big difference and is actually much easier than you might think.”

*What not to say*: 

“It’s morally wrong not to do x, so anyone who doesn’t do x can’t be a good person.”

“I don’t think your behaviour fits with what you claim to believe: if you really believe that, you would do x.”

Think positive: focus on consistency, not inconsistency. Highlight the fact that the behaviour you’re suggesting is consistent with something the person already believes, and not on the fact that their current behaviour is inconsistent with it.

##Encouraging a different reaction

To some extent, trying to advocate something (especially if it’s controversial) is always going to provoke conflict in people. Rather than trying to prevent the conflict occurring altogether, you might focus on encouraging people to resolve it differently; by changing their behaviour rather than justifying it.

The good news is that there’s evidence you *can* actually use cognitive dissonance to your advantage as an advocate. Several studies have found that groups who are made aware of an inconsistency in their attitudes and current behaviour are more likely to change their behaviour than those simply asked about their attitudes.[^6],[^7] For example, households given feedback about their high levels of water consumption combined with a reminder of a previously expressed belief in conserving water significantly decreased their water use relative to those simply given feedback on previous consumption.[^8] This suggests that in some cases, being made aware that their current behaviour was inconsistent with their professed beliefs (“I am responsible in conserving water”) actually made people *more* likely to take on board arguments for conserving, not less.

So how can you frame your case to change behaviour, not cause defensiveness? A few subtleties appear to make all the difference:

1) **Don’t ‘guilt trip’**

Research has repeatedly shown that the more “guilt” nonprofits and commercial advertisers use, the less likely people are to take their messages on board.[^6] [^9] On the other hand, if people can come to realise *themselves* that their behaviour doesn’t square with their values, they’re much more likely to resolve this conflict by changing their behaviour than by justifying it.[^6] 

Why might this be? Recall that when you realise your behaviour contradicts some belief you have about yourself, this causes a “subjectively unpleasant phenomenon”[^10] - that is, it doesn’t feel very nice! If someone feels like you have caused this nasty feeling by trying to guilt-trip them, they’re more likely to [associate](http://www.northlandprep.org/proctor/The%20Association%20Principle.pdf) the feeling with you and your claims, and so seek to resolve it by dismissing them. If, on the other hand, a person is able to acknowledge that this nasty feeling is the result of an internal conflict, it seems more likely they’ll try to resolve it internally by considering all angles, including the one you’re presenting.[^11]

2) **Keep it anonymous**

Whilst you might think “naming and shaming” could encourage people take responsibility for their behaviour, it seems the opposite is true. According to a 1998 study, pointing out inconsistencies in peoples’ behaviour is much more likely to encourage behaviour change if done anonymously.[^12] Participants engaged in public advocacy about the importance of recycling, under one of three conditions:

1) The first group listed their past failures to recycle anonymously,
2) The second listed their past recycling failures and were personally identified,
3) The third did not list past failures at all.

Both those in the first and third group increased their levels of recycling following the advocacy, with those in the first group changing behaviour more than those in the third. However, those in the second group afterwards actually demonstrated a *reduced* belief in the importance of recycling. This suggests that making people aware of inconsistencies in their beliefs and behaviour can motivate behaviour change, but only if done in the right way: like guilt-tripping people, holding them personally responsible doesn’t seem to do the trick.

3) **Make it seem easy**

Part of the reason people are often reluctant to change their behaviour is that it seems like a big sacrifice. Helping people to see that what you’re suggesting isn’t as difficult as they might think can therefore increase the chances they’ll take it seriously. One good way to make something seem easy is to [demonstrate that lots of other people are doing it,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof) and that these other people are [just like them.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof#Similarity_to_the_surrounding_group)[^13]

*What to say*:

“X is really easy to do, and can make a really big difference because...”

“Loads of people have started thinking about x/doing x, and here’s why...”

*What not to say*:

“Doing x requires massive sacrifices, but it’s really important.”

“No-one else cares about this cause except me - please listen to me!”

This post talks about using discussions to get your views across, but you're totally right that the value of discussion is as much about learning things from other people as well.

Yeah, I think your approach to resolving cognitive dissonance in yourself is one we should all strive for. No-one is perfect, sometimes we're all going to act in ways we'd class as immoral - being able to accept this without taking it as a blow to your image of yourself as a "moral" person, and so your self esteem, is hard. But as you say, if we can acknowledge that this is better than messing with your beliefs to justify things, it helps. I think it's really important to emphasise the distinction between "I acted immorally on that occasion", and "I am a bad person" here as well.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>870</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Kim Whittlestone</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>kwhittlestone@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/kim-whittlestone</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-02-03 06:08:46</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great post Jess!

Discussions are great for two reasons: (1) They allow other people to be persuaded through more Socratic means and (2) you can learn things at the same time.

As far as the three methods of resolving cognitive dissonance, #1 is best if we can do it, but sometimes we can't. I've begun adopting a policy whereby, when I'm fairly sure I won't do #1, I at least do #2 instead of #3. That is, I admit that I'm acting immorally, but I'm okay with this, because I realize that's better than distorting my epistemology in order to justify the immorality.

Research Careers and the Matthew Effect
----------------------------------------------------

In [part 1](http://80000hours.org/blog/65-should-you-go-into-research-part-1), I noted that citations in research are distributed by a power law: that is, the best few researchers get almost all the attention. Why is this? One factor is the Matthew effect, in which “the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.”[^1], [^2]



*For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken even that which he hath.

—Matthew 25:29*



In this context, the Matthew effect is that the most accomplished researchers get increasing amounts of credit and attention.[^3] One recent study confirmed the Matthew effect in the careers of 400,000 scientists and 20,000 athletes. The authors suggested that the Matthew effect was a feature of “universal statistical laws” of competitive career progress: they predict that early success plays a crucial role in later success, and progress is much easier when you’re already ahead.[^4] They suggest that this trend is common to all competitive careers. 

The Matthew effect may be a crucial consideration for assessing the probability that you rise to the top of your field. Because “the rich get richer,” early achievements and signs of success increase the likelihood that you’ll be even more successful later. For example, the figure below shows how the power-law exponent for a scientist’s article receiving a given number of citations decreases as s/he has more prior articles with more citations.[^5]

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/70/original/mattheweffect1.png?1357386904'><img alt="Mattheweffect1" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/70/large/mattheweffect1.png?1357386904" /></a>

The h-index in the figure above is the number of publications h by a given researcher with at least h citations. For instance, if you have 8 publications with at least 12 citations, then your h-index is 8. If you have 10 publications with at least 10 citations, and one publication with 9 citations, then your h-index is 10. So, the above figure shows that scientists with higher h-indices have lower power-law exponents for their articles getting cited. This means that their citation distributions have a “fatter tail.” We can use this to estimate, for example, that if your h-index is greater than 100, the expected number of citations of your future papers is twice that of the average researcher.

This manifestation of the Matthew effect may stem from the tendency to cite works by authors who are already highly cited when looking through an article’s references.[^5]


The next figure is another illustration of the Matthew effect: it shows how the period between a scientist’s publications decrease as s/he publishes more articles.[^5]

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/71/original/mattheweffect2.png?1357386905'><img alt="Mattheweffect2" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/71/large/mattheweffect2.png?1357386905" /></a>

The Matthew effect seems crucial to the expected value of choosing an academic career. If you can do a lot of good as a high-profile researcher, then the expected value of this choice could justify this choice even if you’re unlikely to reach your goal. But, if you have good evidence of early success -- indicated, among other things, by publications in top journals, high citation rates, and association with networks of prominent researchers citing each other[^6] -- then the expected value of a research career may be extremely high.

*“When these difﬁcult cases occur, they are difﬁcult, chieﬂy because while we have them under consideration, all the reasons pro and con are not present to mind at the same time; but sometimes one set present themselves, and at other times another, the ﬁrst being out of sight. Hence the various purposes or inclinations that alternatively prevail, and the uncertainty that perplexes us.”*

One huge barrier to making good career decisions (and good decisions in general!) is thinking too narrowly. As Benjamin Franklin points out, often when making difficult decisions there is far too much relevant information for us to hold in our mind all at once. There are too many options, and too many different ways to compare them, to possibly consider this all at the same time. Not only this, it seems we often think we’ve got a broader view than we have. Not only do we have vastly incomplete knowledge for the decision we’re trying to make, but we’re under the illusion that it’s complete, and so don’t even try to expand it. **This is pretty worrying, and it means we could end up missing really great opportunities to make a difference.**

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/78/original/confused-character.jpg?1358182416'><img alt="Confused-character" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/78/large/confused-character.jpg?1358182416" /></a>

There are three key ways in which “narrow framing” can affect career decisions:

**Considering too narrow a set of alternatives**: Before making any career decision, you need to know what your options are. However, it seems that people often consider too narrow a set of options to start with.[^1] 

**Considering too narrow a set of objectives**: Once you’ve got your set of options, to choose between them you need objectives on which to evaluate them. But in fact, people often don’t consider what their objectives are at all,[^1] and at best their lists are incomplete.[^2] 

**Having too narrow a view of the future**: To make good career decisions you need to be able to think about what might happen in the future. But people often overestimate their ability to predict the future and fail to appreciate how uncertain it is.[^3]

In this post I’ll focus on the problem of narrow framing when generating career options, and suggest some techniques for broadening your options. I’ll address the problems posed by the second two types of narrow framing and how to deal with them in upcoming posts.

##Why do we think too narrowly about our career options?

That we think often think too narrowly about our career options seems both intuitively plausible and supported by the psychological literature.[^1], [^2] In particular, a number of common cognitive biases seem to be behind our tendency to think about options too narrowly:

* *[The availability heuristic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic)*: assuming that because something comes to mind easily, it must be good. This suggests we’re likely to overweight options that are readily available, reducing incentives to seek out new or less common options.

* *[Anchoring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring)*: a tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information given when making decisions. This might narrow our options both in number: by making us less likely to consider other options, and in scope: as we’re more likely to consider options similar to the first one. 

Research on creativity also supports this idea that once a first approach to a decision or problem is generated, we find it difficult to consider new alternatives.[^4]

* *[Status quo bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias)*: an irrational preference for the current state of affairs. This suggests that we’re likely to prefer jobs that fit the “status quo”, and not seek out unfamiliar or uncommon options.

* *[The sunk cost fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy)*: we tend to assign more weight to options that we’ve already invested time and effort into. If you’ve spent 5 years in medical school, for example, you’re fairly unlikely to consider options outside of medicine. But the mere fact you’ve invested time or effort doesn’t mean the option is preferable: sometimes [it’s better to just accept these as sunk costs.](http://80000hours.org/blog/111-sunk-costs-in-careers)

These biases are well-established for decision making in general, and there’s no reason to believe they don’t extend to career choice. There’s also some evidence of narrow framing in closely related situations such as business decision making: MBA students, when asked to generate their objectives for choosing an internship generated on average 7 alternatives - but when given the chance to overview each others’ ideas found at least 7 more objectives that they deemed equally important.[^4] Alongside its intuitive plausibility, this suggests that narrow framing is likely to strongly influence many peoples’ career decisions. This is clearly problematic: it might mean you’re just completely missing your perfect career! What can you do about this?

##How can you broaden your options?

1) **Use a framework**

One explanation for why we tend to think too narrowly when thinking through options is that it’s difficult to know where to start. Early or available options provide a starting point, explaining why we may end up anchoring on them.

Having a framework for generating options can provide a starting point whilst ensuring you consider a variety of alternatives. The idea of a framework is to somehow divide the space of possible alternatives into different categories, and then to think through your options in various categories. Making sure you generate options within all categories should help increase the scope of options considered. Using multiple different frameworks for generating options could be an even better way to ensure you consider a wide variety of careers.

Some possible ways of categorising careers for thinking through options:

* By our [5 career types](http://80000hours.org/types-of-career)
* By [sector](http://www.prospects.ac.uk/sectors.htm)
* By [cause](http://80000hours.org/causes)

2) **Talk to other people**

Whilst your own view of the options available to you might be narrow, combining the (even equally narrow) perspectives of a number of people can sometimes create a far broader view. A large body of research suggests that in the right circumstances, groups can generate a much wider set of alternatives than individuals can.[^5], [^6] Other people might well consider career options you’ve overlooked and vice versa. So talking to as many different people as possible about what career options they’re considering could be a really good way to broaden your options.

However, be careful here: emphasis is on talking to as many *different* people as possible. Whilst pooling together multiple perspectives mostly broadens the viewpoint, perspectives that are too similar will tend to have shared blind spots.[^1] People are also easily influenced and can anchor on the options of others if the generating of options is done together. The best way to deal with this is to seek out the viewpoints of as many diverse people as possible, and to each have thought through your own options first before pooling ideas.

3) **“Consider the opposite”**

To prevent anchoring on early, plausible sounding options, a technique called “consider the opposite” may be helpful.[^1] If one option seems particularly attractive or dominant, ask yourself “Why might this option not be as good as I think it is?” Once you’ve highlighted those aspects of existing options which may be less than favourable, ask “What alternatives might be better in these respects?” 

This technique of “consider the opposite” has been found to be useful as a general debiasing technique in a number of situations.[^7] Considering options that appeal for very different reasons than those you already have should simultaneously a) allow you to generate more options, b) help you to consider a wider diversity of options, and c) prevent you from anchoring on early, plausible-sounding options.

In order to work out best practice within career advising, we looked into personality testing. Several people we've asked for advice have recommended that we consider using it.

Having investigated the leading personality tests, however, we’ve concluded they’re not very useful in choosing your career. This is because they haven’t been shown to predict the real world outcomes that matter: (i) finding careers you will find satisfying (ii) finding careers that you will succeed in.

</br>
##Key takeaways: given our findings, what do we recommend?
</br>
1. [Personality tests have not yet shown to be directly useful in picking which careers will fit you](http://80000hours.org/blog/169-how-important-is-fitting-in-at-work), so don’t put much weight on them
2. Be more sceptical about claims about which career might suit you based on personality
3. To [judge your chances of success](http://80000hours.org/blog/132-how-to-judge-your-chances-of-success), [put more weight on IQ](http://80000hours.org/blog/161-intelligence-matters-more-than-you-think-for-career-success), grit and experience.
4. When looking for [job satisfaction](http://80000hours.org/blog/134-our-research-on-how-to-find-a-job-you-love), put more weight on the nature of the work and the quality of the social support in the workplace you’re considering
5. Do plenty of trial and error. There’s a lot we can’t yet predict and don’t know. If you’re wondering whether a job will suit you, the best way to find out is to try it.

##Our findings on personality testing
</br>
The most widely used personality test in the world is the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). There are [plenty of reasons to doubt](http://80000hours.org/blog/242-why-the-myers-briggs-test-is-not-useful-in-picking-a-career) that this test is a good measure of personality. More importantly, there has been very little testing (and nothing within the academic community) of the predictive power of the test.

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/216/original/hollandtypes.png?1376664088'><img alt="Hollandtypes" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/216/large/hollandtypes.png?1376664088" /></a>
*Holland Career Types*

The most well-tested and popular personality test developed specifically for career choice is the Holland Type Test. The academic community has attempted to show that a matching between the Holland type of a person and their workplace is predictive of job satisfaction. To date, [meta-studies have shown no correlation or only a very weak correlation](http://80000hours.org/blog/169-how-important-is-fitting-in-at-work). There’s a good chance this is partly due to some confounding factors and more work needs to be done, but the balance of the evidence now it that Holland type matching is only weakly predictive.

The most widely used personality measure among academic psychologists is the Big 5. This measure does at least have some predictive power in career outcomes. The strongest and most widely agreed finding is that conscientiousness predicts job performance, across a very wide variety of professions.[^1] Turn to the size of the effect, however, and you’ll discover it’s tiny. Typically, conscientiousness only explains several percent of the variance in performance. My impression is that it’s similar for the other well-established predictions based on personality.

What does this mean? Either:
1. Personality is important, but it’s difficult to demonstrate because the interactions are so complex. Further research will show stronger effects.
2. Personality is less important in picking a career than we think.

I think both of these explanations are likely true to some extent. The existing research is pretty crude. For instance, it might be that the personality of your immediate colleagues is very important, but not the personality type of the people who do the work in general. It’s also difficult to design studies that show the full correlation, due to range restriction effects and others. But overall I lean slightly towards (2) being true.

We’ve found other factors that do make a big difference in picking a career. In predicting performance, intelligence, as measured by [IQ, seems to be very important across a very wide range of careers](http://80000hours.org/blog/161-intelligence-matters-more-than-you-think-for-career-success). Often, it explains 30-60% of the variance, meaning that it dwarfs conscientiousness.

An emerging line of research suggests that grit - the propensity to stick to your goals over long periods of time - matters more than conscientiousness. One recent paper[^2] showed that grit could explain 5% of the variance in performance across six different areas, compared to only 2% for conscientiousness. (Though note that IQ was still found to be a much better predictor of performance than grit). Grit is partly is measure of personality, but it’s also partly based on your mindset, which is a product of your beliefs not your personality. Another line of research, for instance as explored in a pop form by Carol Dweck in the book “Mindset”, suggests that certain beliefs about the world can also impact your success, though we’re not yet sure how much.

What could explains the rest of the variance besides personality? We don’t know. Experience can matter. In particular, there’s a fairly strong line of research[^3] showing that thousands of hours of deliberate practice are necessary for expert performance in a wide variety of fields. Some genetic factors have been linked to success, like physical attractiveness and height. A big chunk is likely down to luck. We’d like to explore these factors in the future.

What about finding a satisfying job? [We’ve found](http://80000hours.org/blog/134-our-research-on-how-to-find-a-job-you-love) that the nature of the work itself is the most important thing. After that, what’s important is whether the social environment at work is generally supportive (which doesn’t depend on personality matching). 

All in all, there is plenty of room for these other factors to dominate the role of personality in career decisions.

Why is there so much focus on personality in career choice then? And why do personality tests continue to be so popular? We suspect it’s because the message that certain types of personality suit certain types of job is a nice one. Many of these other factors are much less encouraging. If the nature of the work is what’s important in job satisfaction, then that means that on average some jobs are more satisfying than others.  And you can’t change your IQ or height. The message of the other factors is that you need to change your beliefs about the world and do a ton of work to succeed. That’s also not an easy line to take in a brief careers advising session.

##How to Create a Donor-Advised Fund

There are [a lot](http://www.givewell.org/charities) of charities. So many, in fact, that some would-be altruists are struck with the alliterative [analysis paralysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis) and end up not donating at all.

A tax vehicle known as a "Donor-advised fund" (DAF) allows you to get the best of both worlds - you can donate to charity, with all the psychological and tax benefits that go along with that decision, while still holding off on your decision as to which charity is best.

You can create your own DAF in about 15 minutes online. (Be sure to give it an awesome name like "The Jane Doe Fund for [Paperclip Maximization](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer)" because how many chances do you have to name an organization after yourself?)  Once created, you can contribute money when you feel like it and deduct those contributions from your taxes. Your contributions will sit in an account accruing interest until you decide to write a grant to a specific charity.

There are [interesting questions](http://80000hours.org/blog/10-delayed-gratification-choosing-when-to-donate) about when to put money in a DAF vs. donate directly, but if you are uncertain about the most effective charity, especially if you're so uncertain that you might not donate at all, you should create a DAF.

##Creating Your DAF

Most major investment organizations allow you to create a DAF, such as [Fidelity](http://www.fidelitycharitable.org/), [Charles Schwab](http://www.schwabcharitable.org/public/charitable/home) and [Vanguard](http://www.vanguardcharitable.org/) as well as most local community foundations (if you search for "community foundation" in a standard search engine, you should be able to find one near you). Be sure that you're able to invest in a no-load index fund ([professional investors don't do better than chance](http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/2013/active-mutual-fund-managers-beat-market-index/), so it's not worth paying them a management fee). The major DAF hosts all provide this, so the only real consideration is the management fee they charge. I've found them to be pretty similar, so I just chose Fidelity since my retirement account is already there.
Put a few key details into their form and voilà! You have your own fund!

##What if I don't have $5,000?

The main reason why a DAF might not be right for you is that they require a minimum starting donation of $5,000. If you aren't able to put in $5,000 right away, look into other options that community foundations provide. For example, the foundation near me has an "Acorn Fund", which allows you to donate smaller amounts of money over a longer period of time. 
Another consideration to keep in mind is that you are required to donate to a [501(c)(3)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501c3) organization - that means you can’t put that money into a start-up, and you can’t donate it to an organization without a presence in the US. (Many international charities create a US presence simply for the benefit of 501(c)(3) status, so you will still be able to donate to “international” groups like AMF.)

##Conclusion
I consider myself to be more informed than average about the subject of charity effectiveness, but if you look at my [80,000 Hours profile](http://80000hours.org/members/ben-west) you can see I put all my donations into a DAF. Because even similar-sounding charities can vary in effectiveness by [orders of magnitude](http://80000hours.org/blog/94-how-to-do-one-year-of-work-in-four-hours), it's extremely important to think through your decisions. By using a DAF you can build the "habit" of altruism and take the tax advantages while still ensuring that your money goes to the most effective causes.

I think you raise a very important point when you say:
>Another consideration to keep in mind is that you are required to donate to a 501(c)(3) organization - that means you can’t put that money into a start-up, and you can’t donate it to an organization without a presence in the US.

I think that especially if you are into more speculative causes, the situation that it would be best to move your invested money to a start-up charity that didn't yet have the opportunity to register formally is likely to occur in the future. (Incidentally, I could imagine that CEA was a particularly good donation opportunity before it became a registered charity.)

Have you investigated other ways of committing yourself to donating in the future besides DAFs that don't have this disadvantage? For instance, is there an efficient way to put your money in an ordinary fund and then set up a legally binding pledge to donate everything in that fund to an organisation that is EITHER a registered charity, OR an organisation considered relevantly charitable by some designated board (say, the trustees of CEA) who you will continue to trust in the future? (Of course, with this second type of set-up, you still reap all the tax-benefits at the point at which you pay out to organisations, should you decide to donate to a registered charity after all.)]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1139</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Ben West</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>xodarap00@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/ben-west</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-06-09 17:40:03</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thank you Bastian, you raise a good point. I don't think what you describe is currently available - because you aren't promising it to a tax-exempt charity, you wouldn't be able to claim any deductions, which would make it unattractive for many people.

Something to keep in mind: CEA is still (to my knowledge) not a registered charity in the US. They've just worked out a deal with the Tides foundation whereby donations to Tides are passed along to CEA.

So even "speculative" charities can be tax-exempt, provided they find a sponsoring organization. Since the sponsor often gets a cut of donations, this isn't hard to do, and since that cut is almost certainly smaller than what you would pay in taxes it's better to go the DAF route.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>How to finally do what you've been putting off</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/179-how-to-finally-do-what-you-ve-been-putting-off</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[Commitment devices have boosted my productivity from spending hours or even days procrastinating to consistently achieving my aims. The idea is that you make it costly to fail to do what you say you’ll do. For example, you tell a friend that you have to do 8 hours work a day or you pay them £50. Or maybe you have to shave one side of your body if you fail (I know someone who had to do this!)

<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siren'><img alt="Odysseus_and_the_sirens" class="image medium" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/128/medium/odysseus_and_the_sirens.jpg?1367168930" /></a>

Some tips: 

* Make your pass/fail criteria clear - you don’t want any possibility to wriggle out of your commitment.
* Make commitments with friends so that you have a real person to report to.
* Be careful with commitment devices for creative tasks - test out different ways to incentivise yourself.

There are a few of online ways of setting commitment devices. When combined with a friend monitoring you, these can be very powerful:
* [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/) - if you need to be able to track quantities (like your weight) or adjust your goals regularly. Also good if you like pretty graphs.
* [StikK](http://stickk.com/) - if you have a simple goal you want to commit to.

But I find that just setting up a shared [google spreadsheet](http://drive.google.com) where I log my successes/failures works best.

##What are the benefits?
Commitment devices are the ultimate anti-procrastination tool - they make you more likely to follow through with any valuable action that you’d otherwise tend to put off.

Another benefit is that commitment devices force you to set specific goals and specific goals are more motivating.

###Potential problems
Obviously the loss of money is a potential cost, and you have to set it up so that the loss is costly otherwise the system won’t work. But you can adjust the costs so the amount you pledge is in proportion to how value the action is.

A less obvious cost is decreased motivation. According to evidence in [Drive](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/184767769X) by Dan Pink ([video summary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc)), “carrots and sticks can achieve precisely the opposite of their intended aims. Mechanisms designed to increase motivation can dampen it.” Rewarding people for completion of tasks can be counterproductive for tasks that aren’t routine and require some creativity to complete. So it may be bad to set strict goals for creative tasks. However: 
* It’s often better to do a task sub-optimally than to never do it at all, so it might be worth setting a commitment device for a creative task that you’ve really been putting off.
* I’ve found once I’ve set up my commitment device and started doing the thing I’ve put off, I often enjoy it more than expected and therefore become more motivated. You could try it and see what happens to your motivation.
* There are many mechanical tasks that support more creative tasks e.g. learning new facts and techniques, doing exercises, writing up ideas.
* You can set up process goals that support your creative work. For example, you could have a goal to spend 10 hours a week thinking deeply about problem x. It’s a bit vague, but it could stop you from wasting all your time on superficial tasks like email.

##How strong is the evidence?
Commitment contracts fit with our common sense. It would be weird if people didn’t try to avoid losing money. And there is some evidence that they work. StickK, a website where you can set up commitments with money at stake, [has analysed their 125,000 contracts over the past three years](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/sunday-review/new-years-resolutions-stick-when-willpower-is-reinforced.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1). They found that the more you precommit, the better you do. The success rate for people who don’t name a referee or set financial stakes is only 29%, but it rises to 59% when there’s a referee and to 71.5% when there is money at stake. And when a contract includes a referee and financial stakes, the success rate is nearly 80 percent.

And I liked the suggestion in Change Anything for good incentives: We partly engage in bad habits because our incentives are lopsided - procrastination has short-term rewards; negative consequences are long-term and distant. So you estimate these negative consequences (say, lower salary due to bad work performance and less chance of a promotion), and use these in something like a commitment device.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>When should I quantify? - Quantification - Part 4 </title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/91-when-should-i-quantify-quantification-part-4</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[Every 48 seconds someone dies of malaria. Every one of those deaths is a human being with passions and loves and feelings. When we talk about quantifying our impact on the world it is important not to forget what those numbers mean. They mean people. Every single year of happy life we can give, is a joyful thing to the person living it. This is ultimately why we want to have as much impact as possible. Because more people living happy joyful lives is better than fewer.

<br>
<br>

The last 3 posts have been about quantifying our impact on the world and analysing our effect with numerical methods. But general theories don’t help people with malaria. Their specific applications do. This post is a checklist to run through to decide if you should use quantitative methods on your goal. I will run through the example of malaria treatment, but the checklist is general.

**Step 1: What is the goal?**

Before you begin any project it is important to be very clear about what you are trying to do and why. This way you don’t end up like the fool in every story about a genie, who gets exactly what he wishes for but not what he wants. 

If you want to get rid of malaria remember that you want this because malaria is a terrible disease that kills people. If you ever find yourself with some course of action that could eradicate malaria but at the cost of many many lives it is important that you remember your real goal. The ends often justify the means, but you can only be sure of that if you remember what your true ends are.

**Step 2: Can the goal be quantified?**

Ask yourself if the goal is of a type that can probably be measured well. A good way to think about this is to imagine two different states of the world 5 years from now. One where you have been very successful, and one where you haven’t. How would you prove to a questioning child which one was which? More often than not you’ll point to some thing in the world that there is more of.

Imagine two worlds. One where I spend the whole 5 years working in a charity shop and eventually raise £100,000 to buy malaria nets in the UK and ship them over to Uganda. One where I become a research chemist and discover a really cheap chemical that can be sprayed from the air and which kills only malaria carrying mosquitos and I cure the disease for good. In the first example I’ve bought maybe 20,000 nets and saved about [100 lives](http://givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets#HowcosteffectiveisLLINdistribution), in the second example I’ve saved [655,000](www.who.int/features/factfiles/malaria/en/index.html) lives in the first year alone. 

The second example is much better, but why? It must be because *there aren’t as many people dead*. This focus on “how will I know if I have done well” can tell us which of three types of goal we have:
* Inherently numerical goals, e.g. “get as much money as possible”.
* Goals that can be put in numerical terms only at some loss of detail e.g. “make the lives of people with malaria better, which I will approximate as meaning more [QALYs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year)” 
* Goals that cannot be put in numerical terms at all e.g. “produce the best work of art ever”

If your goal is in the first category then clearly quantitative methods should be considered. If your goal is in the last category then stop here, there is clearly no hope for quantitative methods.

The example I am thinking of falls in the middle category. If this is the case then quantitative methods should be considered, but with caution. They may be very effective, but they may lead us to bad outcomes unless we are careful.

**Step 3: What interventions are there?**

This step requires the most creativity. What possible interventions are there. List all the way you could possibly help the problem. Focus not on finding good ideas but on finding ideas you wouldn’t have thought of normally. Don’t worry that 99% of your ideas are terrible at this stage. 

My first few ideas were: Working for a large chemical firm making insecticides. Working in a bank and using the money to buy nets. Becoming a research scientist finding better treatments. A public education campaign going from village to village teaching people to make their own mosquito nets. Boosting the health services of poor countries by campaigning against corruption.

**Step 4: How good do you expect the non-quantifiable interventions to be?**

Campaigning against corruption is a plan that would be very hard to analyse quantitatively. How do you measure corruption? On the other hand the effect of buying mosquito nets is very well understood. In general there will be some interventions that you can deal with quantitatively and some where it just doesn’t make sense. 

The question now is, which do you think will be the most effective? Specifically do you think that the non-quantifiable interventions are reliably going to be better than the best that the quantifiable methods have to offer? If so you should stop here and go for something from this camp. But if not remember that you are much more likely to find the best possible intervention in a category with quantitative methods than otherwise. 

**Step 5: Research, decide, act.**
If you are still reading at this point then you have a quantitative goal and you think there is a general category of interventions that will be best and which can be analysed quantitatively. All you have to do now is to find that best intervention and do it.

I'm very excited to see our that spin-off [Effective Animal Activism](www.effectiveanimlactivism.org), which [only launched last summer](http://80000hours.org/blog/70-project-launch-effective-animal-activism), has already been able to hire a full-time Executive Director, Jon Bockman. Jon has six years of experience in the non-profit sector, with a special focus on animal causes.

EAA will now become entirely independent from 80,000 Hours, and has a separate board of trustees consisting of [Brian Tomasik](http://80000hours.org/members/brian-tomasik), [Eitan Fischer](http://80000hours.org/members/eitan-fischer) and [Rob Wiblin](http://80000hours.org/members/robert-wiblin).

In the rest of this post, I let Jon explain the new mission and direction of the organisation.

* * *

**The following was written by Jon Bockman and was originally featured on the [EAA blog](http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/eaa-mission-method-and-merger) **

We’re in the midst of an exciting era for effective animal altruists. Animal advocacy groups are getting serious about increasing effectiveness. Every month brings exciting projects, and the volume of new studies and research projects is expanding faster than ever before.

EAA has taken important organizational and strategic steps to powerfully execute our mission in this new era. I am writing to share these exciting updates with you:

1. We’ve hired an [Executive Director](http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/about/meet-eaa) and [Director of Communications](http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/about/meet-eaa), recruited skilled interns and advisors, and embarked on a focused path. We now employ a well-defined mission: **identify and promote the most effective organizations**. We have developed a clear course of action: **conduct and evaluate research, and provide recommendations to the public**.
 
2. To ensure maximum efficiency and maintain a high level of professionalism, we will be splitting our website into two distinct areas. Our main site will feature charity recommendations and official research, and our supplemental site will contain our community and related supportive features. This will allow us to uniquely brand each set of concepts, providing a simple way for users to get what they need as quickly as possible.
 
3. We strategically recognized the importance of establishing an official presence in the United States. This is important not only because we will initially focus primarily on U.S. organizations, but also because the U.S. represents a great opportunity for philanthropic growth. **To this end, EAA has just agreed to merge with U.S. 501c3 charity Justice For Animals!** The new entity will be led by the current EAA board and will maintain the EAA focus and mission. Apart from obvious benefits, this merger enables us to fast-track gaining non-profit status, which means that we’ll be able to accept tax-deductible donations in the U.S. from this point forward! 
More innovative and exciting changes are underway – stay tuned! 

Warm Regards, 

Jon

We’re changing how we do our career coaching. For at least the next couple of months, we’re only going to be coaching one or two people each week, but we’re going to spend up to a week of research on each one. We call these our case studies.

Why the change? Why are we going to turn away at least 80% of our coaching requests? 

Over the last year, we’ve learned a lot about how to improve decisions about career choice. In the summer, we focused on evaluating the career advice that is already out there. Around the new year, we focused on working out the kinds of problems people who want to make a difference confront in choosing their careers. To identify these problems, we spoke to about 40 people one-on-one and asked them to tell us what they found most difficult about choosing a career. We also surveyed students in Oxford and turned to lots of people we respect for their advice.

Doing this research, we developed an understanding of the kinds of problems we could address in career choice that aren’t being well addressed elsewhere. Broadly, effective altruist minded people would like a bunch of concrete, evidence-based ideas for high impact careers and causes, and then they’d like some personalised guidance on how to narrow these down, with a particular focus on impact. So, we came up with a plan to produce reviews of a variety of potentially high impact careers and an individualised planning process delivered via coaching to help people narrow these down. Over the last few months, however, we’ve realised that there is a significant danger of doing research that turns out not to make much difference to actual career choices.

Although we think we’ve gained a reasonable understanding of the broad types of career problems facing altruist minded people, we understand much less about how to *solve* these problems. Which kinds of content will actually change people’s career decisions? You can approach a career decision from a variety of different angles: you could look at the ultimate values of the person concerned or you could drill down to an extremely practical concern, like helping someone with an application, and there’s all kinds of levels in between. We’re not sure where the bottleneck is. For instance, we could prepare lots of research on the salary of law compared to finance, but find that no one decides between law and finance based on this data. Rather, they could choose based on relative ability, or personal preference, the usefulness of the network in each, or something else.

We’ve produced some content over the last few months that we’re confident will be useful to many people. We’re going to write this up immediately for [our findings page](/our-findings). Otherwise, we’re going to hold off, and instead focus on going into more depth with a smaller number of coachees. Talking to fewer people means that we can spend up to the first couple of hours of each case study gathering information about your situation and trying to thoroughly understand (i) which issue will make the most difference in your next decision and (ii) what research would most help you make progress on that issue. After that, we’ll spend several days doing the research, keeping in close contact with you to keep it relevant. This makes sure that the research has as much chance as possible of being relevant to the career decision of at least one member of 80,000 Hours. We’ll also write these studies up, anticipating they’ll be useful both as information and as a concrete example of our approach.

As we do more and more case studies, we aim to build a picture of which issues make a difference *in general* to people who want to have as much social impact as possible. To speed this process up, we’ll prefer to work on issues that we expect to apply to lots of people, drawing on our previous experience and surveys.

Once we’ve spotted an issue we can make progress on that we’re confident is important to lots of people, we’ll write it up for [our findings page](/our-findings) and share it with everyone.

We think that initially focusing on speaking to a smaller number of people will be the fastest way to eventually be useful to lots of people. In the longer term, we’re still aiming to turn our research into some combination of (i) a careers guide (ii) an online planning process (iii) a coaching process that can be delivered on a mass scale.

Focusing on a smaller number of people offers several other benefits. First, it will be easier to track our impact. Second, we’ll be able to focus more on the people who we think will get the most out of our coaching i.e. people who are broadly sympathetic to [our methodology](/our-features) and are open to many different options.

Stay tuned over the next couple of weeks as we release our first case studies and write ups for the findings page.

##The Problem

For-profit companies (including the meat, egg, and dairy industries) spend countless
dollars each year on market research to figure out the best ways to persuade
the public to consume their products. Vegetarian advocacy organizations have
until recently spent virtually nothing to determine the best ways to persuade the
public, despite the fact that their entire success as a movement depends on getting
individual members of the public to change their dietary behavior. Until things
began to change this past year, there had been virtually no research on the impact of
various programs (i.e., no formal comparing of veg advocacy programs against one
another to determine which are most cost-effective), and also no component testing
of specific aspects of a program (for example, does video A or video B persuade
more people to go vegetarian?).

Additionally, while there is a body of useful academic research on vegetarians,
it remains cloistered in unread journals where it is of no use to advocates or
advocacy organizations. Furthermore, many studies provide information that
is only marginally useful to animal advocates. The curiosities of academic
researchers usually do not line up with the pragmatic needs of vegetarian
advocacy organizations. (I should note here that I’ve authored a [book]( http://
www.amazon.com/Change-Heart-Psychology-Spreading-Social/dp/159056233X)
that analyzes the body of research that has already conducted, and distills its useful
lessons for veg advocates.)

Thankfully, the tide is now starting to change. In just the past year at least three
organizations in the United States – The Humane League, Farm Sanctuary, and the
Farm Animal Rights Movement (FARM) – have begun evaluating some or all of their veg advocacy programs and approaches for comparative cost-effectiveness. And the
Humane Research Council has been commissioned by several organizations to test
the relative effectiveness of different veg advocacy videos, why many vegetarians go
back to eating meat, and other things. But there is much more work to be done.

##Why Research Is So Important

Research on vegetarian advocacy (and on vegetarians themselves) is important
because animals’ lives are important. Knowing that video A creates more dietary
change than video B, or pamphlet A creates more dietary change than pamphlet
B, can make an organization’s veg advocacy work more effective. To use just one
example, millions of dollars are currently spent on veg video and leaflet distribution.
Identifying the most effective leaflet and video, and/or improving its effectiveness
by even 10%, would spare hundreds of thousands of additional animals a lifetime of
misery.

And such comparisons, as well as general program measurement, need not be
expensive or time consuming. I recently oversaw a Humane League/Farm Sanctuary
joint study that examined (for the first time) the dietary change impact of leafleting
a college campus, and that also carried out an A/B split test on the effectiveness
of two different leaflets. The entire study cost nothing other than a week of staff
time and a few days of volunteer time to enter and crunch the data. And it yielded
incredibly useful results that have altered decisions at both organizations and that
will help spare the lives of many, many animals.

More broadly, research on the impact of vegetarian advocacy programs forces
organizations to realize that certain programs are dramatically more effective
than others. Hopefully that will guide future spending and prioritization, just as it
most certainly would for any for-profit business. How many animals are helped per
dollar of expenditure through an undercover investigation? What about through a
media campaign? What about through in-person lectures? Research can answers
these questions and help the vegetarian movement become much more efficient at
sparing lives. Research on vegetarians themselves can help organizations target key
demographics that are likely to switch more effectively, use messages that are more
likely to inspire dietary change, and so forth.

##Why Is Vegetarian Research Only Now Starting to Catch On?

If you were to ask any vegetarian advocacy organization “Would you like your
program to become 10, 20, 30% more effective with just a small amount of
extra work?” you’d expect them to jump for joy. But we humans are creatures of
incredible habit, and it’s so hard for us to do something we have not done before.

We assume we know what works and what doesn’t, based on anecdotal evidence, instinct, and so forth. We always want to put what money we have towards
programming itself (an understandable desire). We feel pressed for time and loathe
to take on something new when we don’t know (from experience) that the results
will be useful. We don’t know where we would begin with research, or exactly what
questions it could answer for us. Probably the biggest factor of all is that it just isn’t
on our radar. We haven’t done it before, we don’t know of many other people doing
it, so the thought has barely crossed our mind. Thankfully, that is all changing now,
at least in the United States. Precedent has now been set, with a growing number of
the top vegetarian advocacy organizations beginning to carry out research that is
guiding budgetary decisions and helping improve their cost-effectiveness.

##How Can You Help?
If you work for a vegetarian advocacy organization, especially one with paid staff
and financial resources, carry out research to the extent possible. It’s not hard to
learn how to carry out meaningful, valid research, and you can always seek guidance
from the [Humane Research Council](http://www.humanespot.org) or from other
organizations that have already done similar research. (Or from me, I’d love to help!
Just drop me a line at ncooney@farmsanctuary.org .)

Most importantly, compare the programs you are running to see how cost-effective
each one is so that you may shape future budgets accordingly. All of us would agree
that the right thing to do for animals is spend money on the program(s) that will
help the most animals. So hopefully we will all agree that it’s imperative for us to
take the time to find out which is which! Secondly, consider what researchable
answers would enable you to make your most effective programs even more
effective.

If you are a student or professor interested in carrying out research to help the
vegetarian advocacy movement, speak to a top vegetarian advocacy organization
and ask them what would be most useful to them. Sadly, there are many more-or-
less useless dissertations and studies that well-meaning (and probably vegetarian)
students and professors put an incredible amount of work into to answer a question
that they theorize would enable veg advocates to do a much better job, but which
ends up being of little practical value. The most pressing and most useful research is
likely to be identified by organizations themselves, and it is often simple research on
what approaches and programs create more dietary change per dollar.

And again, if you are interested in or considering carrying out any sort of research,
I’d love to chat with you! You can reach me at ncooney@farmsanctuary.org.

Here’s to the important and growing trend in the vegetarian advocacy movement of
turning to research to improve our effectiveness and save more animals!]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier></dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2013-02-03 20:54:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>873</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Brian Tomasik</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>brian.tomasik@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/brian-tomasik</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-02-04 13:57:45</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is a great introductory post!

One additional reason why veg groups don't do more measurement could be not realizing the positive externalities of research for everyone else. If you do research and publish the results, then all other veg groups can benefit from your findings. Information is a public good.

I'm currently reading two books on effective habit change (The Power of Habit and Change Anything). Getting people to change their diets is obviously habit change, so I thought I'd try to apply a few of the lessons in those books to the case of vegetarianism. Perhaps it's useful to someone.
The Power of Habit is full of research on habits (~50 pages of notes...): Habit change is hard but possible. Habits consist of a cue (e.g. a time of day or a certain enviroment), a routine (e.g. a habit of eating meat, or buying meat in the store), and a reward (feeling elation, anticipating the texture of the meal, and so on). When this 'habit loop' is repeated often enough, you start to crave the reward, and this drives the habit, i.e. makes you act out the habit loop again.
Some potentially interesting things:
- You are trying to make people change their diets. Changing habits is hard; sticking to them, even more so. Assuming that making people vegetarians is cost-effective advocacy, educating them on how to change their habits might be a worthwhile use of resources. (For instance, by referring them to books like those mentioned above.)
- Habits are most malleable (and, for the same reason, humans are most susceptible to advertising) during upheavals in life - pregnancy, divorce, moving town, etc. (That's partly because those upheavals often involve a change in environment, i.e. some of our cues change.) Efforts to make people in these contexts change their diets should be more likely to be successful.
- ~50% of purchases in the supermarket are not conscious decisions, but habitual (!). So even if you commit to buying no more meat, you might buy it out of habit - as if on autopilot.
Perhaps some of these are either applicable or at least suggest questions for more research?]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Trading, donating and charter cities: An interview with Ben Gilbert</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/139-trading-donating-and-charter-cities-an-interview-with-ben-gilbert</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/75/original/Ben_G.jpg?1357736611'><img align="right" alt="Ben Gilbert" class="image small" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/75/original/Ben_G.jpg?1357736611" /></a> 

Ben Gilbert’s an 80,000 Hours member who previously worked as a trader in the City, but now focuses his attention on the effective giving community and the development of charter cities. We met in Oxford to discuss his career, jobs in trading and his plans for making a difference in the future.


**Your first job was as a trader in the city, tell us a bit about why you ended up doing that**

I was a year in to a PhD about Shakespeare but decided I'd had enough of academic discussions that seemed to me rather unreal. Trading seemed to me as real as could be, having to make judgements where everyone would know very quickly if I was right or wrong, plus I thought it might be like playing poker which I enjoyed.

**What did it involve?**

I ended up trading interest rates on emerging markets. I don't have an economics background and so most of what I did involved trying to decide which way everyone else in the market was pushing things – psychology of crowds -  and also about identifying assets which were out of line with one another, in order to buy one, sell the other, and expect to profit when they moved back into line.

What that meant day-to-day was sitting in front of two or three computer screens all day, watching and listening out for prices that seemed out of line with where they should be, following which way markets were moving and feeling good or bad depending on whether I had it right. 

**What were the good sides and bad sides?**

Good sides – A lot of autonomy, with a sense of direct responsibility for an end result. Fairly pure attention to performance so less of a feeling that you had to play a role just to impress others or make them like you. I quite enjoyed following the play of numbers though I can imagine it being boring for many people.

Bad sides – The flip-side to the autonomy: an almost total individualism, with each person fighting for themselves rather than being part of something larger. The institution and almost everyone in it ruled by a spirit of 1) wholly self-interested striving and 2) possession by money, working to earn money by playing with money, talking about money, thinking about money, on and on. Socially, quite a lot of wit but also an anti-women, anti-gay etc schoolboy atmosphere (2 female traders out of 150+ total) that I found annoying. A perverse relationship to time – you spend all year waiting for bonus time to arrive, so end up treating time as something to get through in order to end up with more money rather than the substance of your life.

**Who do you think it would suit?**

I think a genuine interest in how it all works – where prices come from, how they relate to each other – and an ability to be absorbed in a world of moving numbers are important. You can no doubt do it just for the money without any intrinsic interest but I imagine you'll be quite miserable doing it, given how much of your time and energy it is likely to consume. I read a few books on pricing things before my interviews and I think that isn't a bad way of finding out how interesting you find it, as well as helping with the interviews. A certain sort of resilience is probably important – if you're lucky, on 30-40% of the days you go into work, you would have been better off not going as you get it wrong (at least in the sort of work I was doing), and so it helps if you're able to put that easily behind you. A degree of self-confidence/arrogance is useful, especially if combined with an ability to be self-critical.


**After the job in trading, what did you do?**

After about 7 years, I found that the bad sides were definitely outweighing the good sides for me (I had a sense of - what's the good of earning money if you lose yourself in the process) and left. I wonder what it would have been like if there had been an organisation like 80,000 Hours around at the time, which would have helped me to frame what I was doing in a different way and to see it as less totally selfish, perhaps even the opposite. Anyway, there wasn't. I ended up starting to learn Russian, which led me to live in Kiev for a few years, studying Russian and teaching on English literature.

**What advice would you give to someone considering a job in finance?**

Find out what you can about specific roles and even specific markets and sectors. People often focus on earning possibilities and other extrinsic reasons to take different roles and, of course, that's why almost everyone is there. But once you're doing it, the intrinsics of the job, what it's like hour by hour actually to be doing it, can often overwhelm the other aspects. If that isn't right, it can be hard to carry on for long. It's difficult to know or imagine in advance what it will be like, but digging into something at some depth might give you some idea of how engaging you find it and a hint of what it would be like to spend your working life in that area.

**What prompted you to start thinking about how you could make a difference?**

I think that we all know that we are, as the phrase goes, living high and letting die, but that the moment at which you actually start to care about this and want to do something about it is quite personal and perhaps mysterious. For me, it emerged from some reflection on what I had done right and wrong over the previous year, which, for reasons I am not sure I could explain, made me actually want to do something in the area where, it seems to me, we have the most influence on the lives of others, which is in our relations to those generally far away individuals who have far less power and resources than we do.

**What did you start doing?**

I started reading about development economics and aid. I haven't stopped yet and so in a sense I can't say I've started doing anything at all. I have, though, found a couple of things that I am dedicating time to and want to encourage other people to think about, because I think that understanding them better could have a big impact. One is the question of what the impact is on other people, especially the poor, of all the different things we can do with money apart from giving it to charity, as I wrote about [here](http://80000hours.org/blog/59-the-wider-consequences-of-giving-away-money). I think different choices could have quite different impacts but it is hard to understand them. The other is Paul Romer's idea of charter cities, which appeals to me a lot (although I've plenty of questions and reservations).

**Explain a bit more about charter cities. Why do you think they might be a particularly good area to work on?**

So many development problems seem to result from unhelpful governance or bad institutional or behavioural equilibria. The most obvious solution for people in badly governed places who want to live somewhere better governed – just move there – is generally impossible because those better governed places won't let them in. Charter cities are an idea about how to create an alternative. A charter city would be a territory with its own laws and political system, which people from the surrounding state and perhaps other states are free to move in and out of.

The idea is: take a city-sized piece of uninhabited land; write a charter outlining its laws and politics and recruit people to administer it; see if businesses think the territory has a promising enough future to invest in creating jobs, infrastructure and housing there; then see if people decide it's a good place to live and move in. If things work well, then people gain a new choice when they think about where they want to live, and millions of them could end up moving there; if they don't, no-one moves in and no-one loses anything (apart perhaps from businesses who made a bad business decision in trying to get the city started). (Obviously, things aren't so simple but this is the essence of the idea)

I find that most people don't like the idea, but they are confused about what they don't like. Generally they think that it couldn't happen, or it could happen but the cities would be bad places to live. They might well be right, but neither is a reason to oppose the idea. Even if there is only a small chance of them working, the gains could be huge. And if they happen and turn out to be bad places to live, why would anyone move there? You have to make an argument that a city growing through people's choices to move there would somehow do more harm than good (such arguments can be made, but I haven't seen them explored much).

I decided to work on this because I became convinced of the importance of governance issues; don't know of any idea that addresses these issues so directly and radically; think it's plausible, because it relies for the most part on the self-interest of different agents; and think that the chances it is tried and how well it works will depend on how the idea is understood by publics, by the politically influential, and by more technical and academic audiences. I was surprised that there was no proper independent source of news and analysis, and I'd like to change that. However, one reason I started working on them was because the government of Honduras was planning to set one up, which made it seem likely that the idea would be implemented ('can't happen? It's already happening!') and also made it urgent to take a more careful look at how it should be done. A couple of months ago, the Supreme Court there ruled against it, and at about the same time the new leadership in Georgia stopped work on one that was planned there, so the odds of it ever happening seem lower now than they were before.

A more personal reason I'm interested is probably that I've spent some time in badly governed places – my gap year in Zimbabwe, 6 years recently in Ukraine. I think it can be hard for people who live in well-enough functioning states to grasp just how bad some governments (more accurately, political, legal and administrative systems) can be, and how much this hurts the people who live there; also, how painful it can be to know that the states across your border which work better are doing everything they can to keep you out.

**More generally, do you think one of the most important things to be doing is research into what are the most important things to be doing?**
Probably. I think it is probably true that people are not led into where they can have the most impact by some self-organising process, and that research can suggest where they could have more impact; it's very possible that they are having much less impact than they could, and some simple pointers that research and reflection can uncover could make a big difference. One danger, though, is the mistake of answering the question by asking, 1) what is the most biggest problem/issue/threat, 2) what can I/we do about that. You might be able to do a lot more good by working on smaller problems which you have more influence over. Asking about the big challenges is a good starting point, but this needs to be balanced by ideas about what certain individuals can change in the world, given how the world is.



**How did you find 80,000 Hours?**

The first time I came across it was in a written debate Ben Todd and Sebastian Farquhar had with a critic in the [Oxford Left Review](http://oxfordleftreview.wordpress.com/2012/07/05/olr-issue/), which I found by chance as I searched for articles relevant to what I'm working on. I thought that they won the debate, and they put their ideas in a direct, open-minded, undogmatic way which made me want to find out more.

**What attracts you to the project?**

First, the idea is in a sense so simple – wanting to do good, and wanting to learn how you can do it best (though actually working out an answer isn't simple at all). I think that beginning with the personal decisions that each person faces is the right place to start, and trying to think the issues through carefully is the right way to move forward. Second, I think the project rightly emphasises the importance of community – since there is a sort of largely unspoken consensus at large that just serving yourself and the people closest to you is the way to live, it's important to have a counter-community developing a different view. Third, from what I can work out, there are some really smart people with a lot of integrity who are involved. It will be fascinating to see how it plays out – whether sceptics who think that most people's ideals won't survive 5 years of contact with 'the real world' will turn out to be right, or if it will grow into something really powerful as numbers increase and all the people who participate gain experience and influence.

**What are your plans now for the next couple of years?**

I want to read and write more on the consequences of different ways of using and investing money, and on charter cities. I'd like to create a couple of websites with high-quality work on both topics, so that there is some sort of independent and informative source for people to turn to - I don't think that exists at the moment in either case. It would be great to find people with relevant expertise who could give their ideas and perspectives. For example, on the question of what to do with money, that might mean economists who can help trace the causal chains from particular investment or savings decisions to their welfare consequences, especially for the (global) poor. The next task would be trying to find ways of making that information more influential on how people and institutions actually behave.



**How did you come up with these plans and why do you think this is good option for you to be working on? What are the biggest uncertainties in your career?**

I started with becoming confident that the two ideas I'm most interested in are important and that work which affected how they are implemented could have a lot of impact. When I was trying to understand and explore them, I found that there isn't much to read, and many questions are unasked. I think that some answers could make a lot of difference, if they end up guiding action (eg if certain ways of investing money have much more positive welfare consequences than others). Few people seem to be working on or even thinking about these things. If I'm right about their importance, then this seems to be a space in which my work could have a large impact.

I'm not sure that I have the skills for doing it effectively. I think that just asking the questions is an asset, if I'm right that they matter and are underexplored (the alternative is that I'm missing something which explains why people aren't working on them), and I can analyse and think the ideas through well enough. On the other hand, I don't have much economics, which is a drawback, and don't know how effectively I can persuade other people. I'd say I'm more confident in the importance of the questions than my approach to helping to develop influential answers to them. I see what I'm working on now as a first step which should help me to be clearer about what I think and, I hope, build links with other people thinking along similar lines, but might well lead me to something different, eg working in an organisation within which I could have more influence over more resources.



**Is there anything I should have asked you but didn’t?**

You could have asked me what I in fact do with any income / savings I have. It is a little ambition of mine - though one which I don't have much hope of realizing - to ask all sorts of people who profess to care about ethical issues (moral philosophers, activists, some economists, etc) what they do with their money - give to charity (which one?), spend it (on what?), invest it (where?), and so on. With actual figures, if only percentages! Not in order to catch them out in some sort of hypocrisy, but because I'm really interested in how other people decide these things. If it turns out that people don't bring their moral ideas to bear at all on what they do with money, that's interesting and reveals something about what governs people's actions, making you wonder whether this might change or is something that we just have to work with. And if they do, I'm interested in how they do it – in the answer they give to a moral question which is embodied in how they live.

#Choose the best thing to work on - effective prioritisation
When you prioritise, you make sure that you’re doing the most important work possible. This means both choosing tasks that are important and focussing on the most important parts of tasks that you’re doing.

##Choosing the most important tasks
Some activities have many more times more impact than others. For example, if you’re learning a new skill you’ll improve very quickly at the start as you learn the fundamental skills and then your progress will slow. For example, in language-learning the first hundred words you learn are [by far the most useful, often gaining you ~80% coverage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law). Someone who makes sure they learn the most common words can thus reach conversational fluency several times faster than someone who picks more randomly from the most common couple of thousand words.

Finding big differences in the effectiveness within tasks of the same kind is so common that the rule of thumb has been given a name: the 80/20 principle. It states that *roughly 80 percent of your impact will come from 20% of the things you do.* This suggests that in general, time spent working out which tasks from a set are most effective will be well rewarded, enabling you to achieve several times as much as you would have otherwise.

##Focussing on the most important parts of tasks
Prioritisation also applies when doing tasks as well as when choosing them. Often you don’t need to produce a perfect piece of work - you can apply the 80/20 idea and do 20% of the work for 80% of the impact. For example, if you’re writing a report most of the benefit will come from just covering the main points, not from going into details or polishing the phrasing and formatting. Our natural tendency, however, seems to be to [continue with what we’re doing](http://80000hours.org/blog/107-good-generals-let-their-soldiers-die-in-vain), even if it’s no longer the most effective thing. Resisting this tendency by constantly asking ‘is this the most effective 20%?’ can enable you to achieve several times as much in the same amount of time.

##What are the potential problems?
The main cost of prioritising tasks is time. For day-to-day prioritisation, this is low. I estimate the cost of using a task management system as 5% of your time, so the cost of day-to-day prioritisation is a part of this. A larger cost may be prioritisation on the large scale - e.g. prioritising your whole career direction for the next few years. This could take a lot of time, but the potential benefits are huge. We know that some careers have hundreds of times more impact than others, so it’s probably worth spending a few extra hours thinking about which career to pursue.

One thing to be careful of is that the 80/20 rule sometimes doesn’t appear to apply. There are some cases where it’s important to do a task to perfection because there is a disproportionately large benefit to being the best. Most competitions are like this - e.g. competing for a prestigious scholarship. Projects to gain publicity are also like this - producing the one of the most shared TED talks will bring you many times more publicity than just producing an average TED talk.

##How strong is the evidence?
There are no studies on the value of attempting to prioritise in general (since it's such a generic skill). But you can work out whether to spend time prioritising when you reach a new task area. Before you start prioritising you can have a quick think about whether the task area has tasks that differ a large amount in effectiveness, and whether you can work out which tasks are most important in advance in a short enough amount of time to make it worth doing. If it does, then it’s probably worth prioritising.

##Our recommendation
 
* When you begin working on a new area or project, make a quick assessment of how important it is to prioritise the tasks. Our impression is that it's usually worth it because the differences in impact between tasks within an area tend to be large.
* Second, ask yourself whether you can get 80% of the benefit of doing this project by doing only the most important 20% of the work.

Unfortunately, it's easy to know what's really important, but to end up getting distracted by less important but urgent day to day tasks.

To help with this we recommend:
1. Having a task management system [link] and when you do your regular reviews (daily, weekly, and monthly) make sure to prioritise your tasks and projects.
2. Also keep track of how well you prioritised over the past week by noting the least important things you did and the most important things you didn’t do.
3. For each time period, set the main tasks that you want to achieve in that period. For example, each day, [define three most important tasks to do from your priority tasks for the week, and then do them first](http://zenhabits.net/purpose-your-day-most-important-task/). When you choose these most important tasks remember to include [important but not urgent tasks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method). We tend to not do these but they are the sort of tasks that can improve our productivity in the long run.

#It’s not all what it seems#

You may think I’m being cynical when I say most volunteering is usually not that helpful. But many charities agree with me. [FORGE](http://blog.givewell.org/2008/11/12/is-volunteering-just-a-show/), a charity that looks after refugees, shifted its focus away from volunteers to a model that should have been able to help people more effectively. It turns out, that was a bad move for them – because their volunteers were also their chief fundraisers. Their income plummeted. Many charities have similar experiences – volunteers are an important investment, but they don’t directly contribute to the charity’s good works.

It’s not even usually true that a volunteer is free for a charity. There are substantial costs to managing and engaging volunteers. That’s usually worth it for a charity, because they’re counting on you to donate later. But it’s not a great start.

That’s not even taking into account the peculiar practice of getting lots of people to put huge amounts of time and effort into baking cakes and/or buying things in order to then auction them off (often below cost) in order to donate the proceeds to charity.

#Let’s do it right#
What I’ve just described sounds awful, but of course it isn’t. Even if that’s all there was on the table, it would still make sense to volunteer, in the same way that it makes sense to engage in any fun activity. Besides, even if the volunteers I’m describing aren’t helping as much as they possibly could, they *are* still helping. But we can do so much more. What are some ways to be a high-impact volunteer?

###Volunteer for cost-effective organisations###
Look for organisations that work on high impact [causes](/causes). And within these organisations, look for those that are transparent and have [demonstrable, proven impact.](http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities)

Even better, look for organisations that have detailed cost-effectiveness evidence and a clear need for more resources.

###Volunteer for labor-constrained charities
Some charities actually have plenty of money (they’ll never admit it though!). What they really need are talented people who have a lot of knowledge and enthusiasm about the cause they’re working towards. Some charities could hire the first person who came to them with the skills they need, but they don’t know if that person exists. You might not be looking for a job, but if you’re that sort of person then you’ll be a very high impact volunteer.

###Highly skilled volunteers are good
If you have rare and valuable skills, volunteering those skills to an organisation makes great sense. They would often not be able to afford your services otherwise, and would do less well as a result. For example, some small charities spend a substantial portion of their budgets hiring external accountants and lawyers. Particularly if you have really rare knowledge of a particular field, your time might literally be worth more than that of anyone else in the world.

###Volunteer your enthusiasm
Nine times out of ten, what a charitable organisation really wants more than anything else is that you tell all your friends about them and try to persuade them that the charity is important. After all, you have something special that no-one else does: the ability to share new ideas with your friends and energise them. Rather than volunteering your time to an organisation, make a point of bringing that organisation up in conversation. You’ll do it much more good that way.

###Don’t do replaceable things
The volunteer jobs that do the least good are ones that are easily replaceable. Volunteering for unskilled labour jobs is often fairly low impact, particularly if those jobs are in the developing world. If you’re flying to Africa to build houses you should think again - odds are you’re taking someone else’s job over there, and then doing it badly. Think about donating the cost of air-fare to an effective organisation, and reduce your carbon dioxide emissions.

###Volunteer your money
Particularly if you have a high-earning job, there’s an element of silliness about volunteering in a low-skilled role. An extra hour of your work could hire several people to do the low-skilled work, and there’s a good chance they’d all be better at it than you. It can help the cause you care about much more to just [donate.](/donating)

If you’re looking for volunteering roles that fit these rules of thumb there’s some help. The main page on [volunteering](/volunteering) has a lot of these thoughts and some others, with some specific suggestions. A good shortcut is that organisations that care a lot about their effectiveness (like [us](/volunteer)) will not take you on as a volunteer unless they think that you’re actually going to make a difference.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>n</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2012-10-28 20:17:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>669</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Ruairí Donnelly</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>rd5683@hotmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/ruairi-donnelly</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-10-29 00:56:43</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Awesome!

I think your point is often not understood and can be really under appreciated. However, I think you’ve also left out one of the most important things to consider when young people are looking at volunteering! I think that it’s important for young volunteers to keep in mind the SELF-FOCUSED reasons for volunteering!

I’m a young professional who has volunteered for many domestic charities, lead service trips, and done a small fellowship with an international nonprofit.

A lot of the time, young people choose to volunteer do so because they enjoy doing the work with a group of friends in that way or because they want to travel and learn about something interesting or exotic. (I don’t mean to be cynical about this, because it can still be a helpful thing) In this context, I think people should worry most about enjoying themselves, engaging with workers/beneficiaries of the charity, and generally seeking out compelling and meaningful experiences, since they’re not likely to improve the organization much directly with their work, and they’ll be more emotionally inclined to support the charity in the future (because our emotional experiences play a huge role in having the personal energy to support a cause!). You can keep this in mind even when you’re the volunteer yourself or you're helping form an experience for others.

Also, a lot of other volunteering is also done to gain a particular kind of career experience. In this case, volunteers should be mindful that its hard for them to make a strong impact with their work (their projects will mostly be forgotten/fall by the wayside in the future), and instead worry about building up their own capacities and knowledge. In this way, the true, long-term impact of the volunteering is the experience that will let the volunteer accomplish more in their career future.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Do you think you're better than average?</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/124-do-you-think-you-re-better-than-average</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[**Most people think they’re better than the average person**: that they’re smarter, more likeable, more attractive.[^1] 

Maybe you don’t think this is you. Maybe most people think they’re better than average, but you’re not as big-headed as most people. Maybe you’re more modest than the average person. 

Or maybe your modesty is just another trait you’re overestimating.

*The Dunning-Kruger effect*

**This tendency to think of ourselves as “above average” is a well-established bias.** 

It’s commonly referred to under several names: [illusory superiority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority), the *better-than-average effect*, or, my personal favourite, the [Lake Wobegon effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Wobegon) - after [Garrison Keillor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrison_Keillor)'s fictional town where “all the women are strong, all the men are good looking, and all the children are above average." A closely related bias is the [Dunning-Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect), where incompetent or unskilled people fail to recognise their own incompetency (of course, I’m sure you’re not incompetent or unskilled, so this one doesn’t apply to you...)

In a study conducted by psychologists Hoorens and Buunk, high school students were asked to estimate how true a number of personality traits were of themselves, and of the average student. Results showed that students rated themselves significantly higher than average on positive traits (such as honesty, persistence and originality) and lower than average on negative ones (such as hostility, vanity and reasonableness.)[^2] There are a ton more studies[^3] which demonstrate this tendency to rate oneself as above average: ninety percent of drivers think they are better than the average driver[^4], and most students think they are more intelligent than the average student[^5]. I wouldn’t be surprised if you reckon you’re less susceptible to the standard [cognitive biases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) than most.

**Why do we do this?** 

What might explain the results of these studies?

“Average” appears to carry some pretty negative connotations: calling someone average is a bit like saying they’re nothing special. So it’s only natural that we tend not to want to think of ourselves as “merely” average. It’s also been suggested that the [focalism bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority#Focalism) may play a part: a tendency to assign greater to significance to whatever is the focus of attention. So when comparing ourselves to others, we may view our own positive traits as more significant than those of others. This means we end up overestimating our abilities or characteristics in relation to those of other people.

**Does it apply all the time?**

Further studies suggest that there are certain situations in which this superiority effect is much stronger than others. People are much more inclined to judge themselves as superior when asked to compare themselves to a hypothetical “average person”, than some specific other person.[^6] So maybe we don’t actually think we’re better than everyone else, but our idea of “average” is somehow distorted (as suggested above, it has some pretty negative connotations.) When we’re asked how we compare to average, we have to evoke some “picture” of what the average person looks like. Since we don’t like to think of ourselves as mediocre, what may be happening here is that we choose a comparison target who scores lower than ourselves. 

The bias is also much stronger when people are asked to “compare themselves to the average person” than when asked to “compare the average person to themselves.” This might sound crazy: the two are clearly the same! [Snyder and Fromkim](http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/Class/Psy418/Josephs/Wynne%20Folder/28-Uniqueness%20Seeking.pdf) explain this inconsistency by suggesting that we have each have a desire to think of ourselves as unique. Admitting that you’re “just like other people” seems to threaten uniqueness a lot more than saying “other people are a lot like me.”

**Why is it a problem?** 

If we need to do this to feel better about ourselves, who cares? The problem is that if we overestimate how great we are, how smart we are, we’ll also overestimate our chances of being successful. People who think they’re better than average also tend to think that good things are more likely to happen to them than others, bad things less likely. (Illusory superiority can be viewed as a specific case of the more general [optimism bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias))

The more we overestimate ourselves, the more likely we are to take unwarranted and even dangerous risks. We’re also likely to overestimate our chances of success in a career. We’ll think we’re more likely to rise to the top of a big firm, to become an influential policy maker or academic, or to start a successful business. 

I’m not saying you don’t have a good enough chance of doing these things to make it worth trying. But if you want to work out where to make the most difference, you need to have a realistic idea of where your chances of success are best. So next time you find yourself thinking “I know most people fail at this/find it really hard, but I’m not most people...”, stop and think for a second. Do you really have good reason to think your chances are any better than anyone else?

It’s technically possible for most people to be “better” than the mean in a given respect: most people have more legs than the mean number of legs in the population (which is less than 2, since the distribution is highly skewed.) It’s logically impossible for most to be above the median, however, for this would amount to the majority of the population being in the top 50%.

If you can convince just one other person to care about a cause as much as you, then you’ve easily doubled your impact. But peoples' efforts at influencing others often aren’t as efficient as they could be. Just as people tend to give to the charity that resonates with them most personally, they often spend years trying to convince friends or family of a cause they care about. What many people don’t realise is that by stepping outside your circle of personal contacts and choosing a strategic approach, your time and influence can go ten or even a hundred times further.

*Joe Espinosa*

Over the past 10 years, [Joe Espinosa](http://www.veganoutreach.org/enewsletter/espinosa.html) has likely convinced somewhere between 4,000 and 13,000 people to turn vegetarian.[^1] The estimates of [animal](http://www.peta.org/living/vegetarian-living/vegetarian-101.aspx) [advocacy](http://www.veganoutreach.org/articles/saveanimals.html) organisations suggest that one person turning vegetarian saves around 100 animals from factory farming per year, mostly poultry. (In fact, [this may turn out to be a very conservative estimate](http://www.countinganimals.com/how-many-animals-does-a-vegetarian-save/).) Given this, we can estimate Joe’s impact as saving at least 4,000 * 100 = 400,000 animals from factory farming each year. Supposing each person he convinces remains vegetarian for on average 5 years, the number of animals saved from a life in a factory farm is closer to 2 million. And this doesn’t factor in the ripple effect: that many of the people convinced will likely influence others themselves. Safe to say, the guy’s overall impact in terms of improving animal welfare is huge to say the least, much more than he could have achieved just by becoming vegetarian himself.

What voodoo magic does Joe use to have such an enormous impact? He goes round US university campuses and hands out Vegan Outreach flyers. Simple but incredibly effective. For every 300 leaflets an activist distributes, its estimated that around three to ten people turn vegetarian. [^2] This means you could at least triple your impact on the animal suffering cause in little over an hour’s work, if you do it right. 

Going out and talking to people you don’t know about your cause might seem intimidating, and it might take some time to work out how best to do it. But if you do it well [it’s a pretty surefire way to have a huge impact.](http://www.veganoutreach.org/articles/whyleaf.html)

The hardest part is getting over the initial awkwardness of approaching strangers with a cause you care about. But it only takes a few days’, or at most weeks’, experience for the process to become natural and even enjoyable. Having learned how to approach strangers and make a good case for what you care about, you will be able to achieve more through advocacy for the rest of your life. Effective advocacy is a method for doing good that is accessible to almost anyone who is willing to practice what works.

##How to be an effective advocate

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/65/original/leafleting.jpg?1356297084'><img alt="Leafleting" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/65/large/leafleting.jpg?1356297084" /></a>
*Jon Camp leafleting with Vegan Outreach booklets at Slippery Rock, U in PA*

1) **Choose your target audience carefully**

Part of what made Joe Espinosa so effective was that he chose his target audience carefully. You’ll clearly have a much greater impact if you think carefully about what kinds of people will be most receptive to your message. There’s a good case for targeting university students.[^1] They’re likely more open-minded and willing and able to change. People are hugely influenced by the norms of their peer group, so young people whose peer group is more in flux are most likely to reconsider their views. Influencing people at a young age also simply increases the full impact, as they have more of their lives ahead of them to enact change. The nature of a university campus in itself also means it’s a good way to reach large numbers of people in a small amount of time. 

2) **Appearances matter**

In *Change of Heart*, [Nick Cooney](http://80000hours.org/members/nick-cooney) tells the story of an environmental campaigner speaking at a rally to an enthusiastic group of young campaigners:

"He shouted to the crowd, *“Are you ready to get out there and fight for the environment?”*
To which they responded an enthusiastic, “Yeah!”
*“Are you ready to get arrested and go to jail for the environment?”*
“Yeah!!”
*“Are you ready to give your life for the environment?”*
“Yeah!!”
*“Are you willing to cut your hair and put on a suit for the environment?”*
The crowd fell silent."[^3]

You may well feel that the way you dress is pivotal to your sense of self identity, and so be reluctant to change it. However, the way you appear to others undoubtedly has a huge affect on how persuasive you are. Attractive people are more persuasive, but it’s not just about good looks: research also shows that people are much more open to persuasion by people who look similar to them.[^4] Changing the way you dress so that your target audience take you seriously could therefore be incredibly important.

3) **Be friendly**

As well as your physical appearance, the way you present yourself to others in terms of your attitude is vital to being effective in your advocacy. Always be kind and courteous: even if others are rude to you. Never tell someone they’re wrong in their view, but rather express acceptance of others’ views: if possible help them to see how what you’re saying is consistent with what they already believe. Above all, smile, be optimistic and outgoing: this makes you attractive and is much more likely to make people listen to your message.

4) **Position yourself carefully**

If you catch people at the wrong time or in a bad mood, even if you’ve targeted yourself perfectly to be persuasive in all other ways, you probably won’t have much luck. Whilst people’s moods are pretty much out of your control, there are ways to position yourself to try to optimize how receptive people are to your message. Studies suggest that positive associations are very powerful: people are more easily persuaded when the message is accompanied with good food for example, suggesting why business meetings are often arranged over lunch! [^4] Obviously you’re not going to take every person you hand a flyer to out for a (vegetarian) meal, but positioning yourself in a cafeteria might be a good way to take advantage of this. Other positive associations are worth bearing in mind: people will be likely more receptive to your message on a sunny day than on a rainy one. 

People tend to follow the crowd. It’s been shown that if a sequence of people in a row turn down a flyer, the next person is more likely to say no too. So if you get a stream of “nos”, better to take a break or move location and start afresh.[^1]

5) **Hone your message**

The same cause can be much more or less compelling depending on the way in which it is presented. Just as it is good to dress like the people you are trying to influence, it is best to adopt on their beliefs and ways of speaking insofar as you can, rather than try to change their mind on too many things at once.

Joe Espinosa knows that the vast majority of people are already opposed to whatever they consider ‘animal cruelty’. Framing the issue of vegetarianism as one of animal cruelty simplifies his task, because whoever he speaks with starts by agreeing with him that it is wrong to treat animals in a cruel way. All he then needs to do is persuade the person you are speaking with that the way animals are treated on farms is cruel. Research also suggests that people who become vegetarian because they are concerned about animal welfare are more likely to remain vegetarian and convince friends and family to join them, than those who become vegetarian out of concern for their health, or the environment. A little bit of work learning things like this can ensure your time is well spent.

It can be hard for people to change their mind on these issues quickly. Rather than insist on a full conversion immediately, get your foot in the door so they can begin persuading themselves. For instance, encouraging people to reduce their consumption of the products worst for animal welfare - eggs and meat from caged birds. Having taken that step, the person is more likely to view themselves a person who cares about the issue and investigate it on their own.

You will also do well to let the people you are speaking with talk most of the time. Ideally, they will persuade themselves of the issue you raise, with just a little nudging in the right direction. For instance, rather than monologue about why he is vegetarian, Joe asks people why they choose to eat meat - something they have often not thought about. After listening carefully and politely, he can choose further questions for whoever he is speaking with.

One small point:
"Supposing each person he convinces remains vegetarian for on average 25 years over their life (they were mostly university students), the number of animals saved from a life in a factory farm is closer to 10 million"
Doesn't this assume that each person Joe convinces wouldn't have become vegetarian if it hadn't been for Joe? But surely Joe is not the only force shaping individuals towards becoming vegetarians. So if Joe convinces someone to become vegetarian, he may 'just' be bringing forward in time when that person becomes vegetarian. This is likely to be the case for at least some of the individuals that Joe convinces. So the estimate as it stands is probably overly optimistic.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>786</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Benjamin Todd</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>benjamin.john.todd@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/benjamin-todd</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-12-26 14:47:58</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think EAA assumes Vegan Outreach and The Humane League persuade people to stay vegetarian for about four years in their cost-effectiveness estimates of online vegan ads.

It should be possible to trace the persistence of veg'nism over time using longitudinal surveys of eating habits that already exist.

Also note that while bringing forward vegetarianism by 25 years is probably an overstatement for most converts, social influence studies (described in Change of Heart) suggest that each person who makes a life change convinces more than one other person to do the same just by setting the example. I expect this is an overestimate, but it's still likely to be an important effect.

Combined with Brian's point about the impact on people who don't immediately convert, the total 25 extra years of vegetarianism doesn't seem unreasonably high. Evidence on this point would be great to collect though.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>838</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Gina</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>gstuessy@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-01-20 02:19:11</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA["Research also suggests that people who become vegetarian because they are concerned about animal welfare are more likely to remain vegetarian and convince friends and family to join them, than those who become vegetarian out of concern for their health, or the environment."

As far as Roman’s point, “surely Joe is not the only force shaping individuals towards becoming vegetarians,” here’s a comment I wrote to a friend a few weeks ago:

"Yes, some of the people we convince were already on the border, but there might be lots of other people who get pushed further along and don’t get all the way to vegism by our influence. If we picture the path to vegism as a 100-yard line, then maybe we push everyone along by 20 yards. 1/5 of people cross the line, and this is what we see, but the other 4/5 get pushed closer too. (Obviously an overly simplistic model, but it illustrates the idea.)"]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>790</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Brian Tomasik</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>brian.tomasik@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/brian-tomasik</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-12-27 06:43:03</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Here’s an elaboration on the 100-yard-line model for veg conversion. Say there are K influences encouraging people toward vegism (e.g., The Humane League’s veg ads, work by other veg groups, movies like Food, Inc., influence by friends, religious sentiments, etc.). Say there are N total veg conversions due to all these factors combined. Let p_i, i = 1, …, K be the relative amount by which each influence pushes people along the 100-yard line. For example, if The Humane League’s veg ads push people twice as far or push twice as many people as hearing news stories about factory farming does, then p_{THL} = 2 p_{news stories}. Let f_i = p_i / (sum_i p_i). If the influences come in a random order (e.g., sometimes veg ads happen before influence by friends and sometimes influence by friends happens first), then the number of observed conversions due to the i’th influence will have the expected value f_i * N, because, for example, an influence that pushes people twice as far along will result in them crossing the finish line twice as much, and an influence that reaches twice as many people will result in twice as many crosses of the finish line. In other words, in apportioning responsibility for veg conversions, the actual number of people that you cause to cross the finish line is an unbiased estimator of your fractional causal contribution to all N veg conversions.

The intuition is that, yes, some of the people you convert with veg ads would have gone veg due to other reasons. But some of the people you don’t convert will now go veg due to something else because you helped them along the road.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>How to add value in international development: an interview with Eva Vivalt</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/193-how-to-add-value-in-international-development-an-interview-with-eva-vivalt</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently interviewed [Eva Vivalt](http://www.evavivalt.com/), who works for the World Bank and is the founder of [AidGrade](www.aidgrade.org), a new organisation that evaluates and recommends different development programs on the basis of effectiveness. AidGrade’s mission is “to improve the effectiveness of development efforts by understanding and encouraging what works using rigorous, actionable and engaging evidence.” You can find out more about AidGrade on their [website](www.aidgrade.org).
 
<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/157/original/AidGrade-logo.jpg?1370450850'><img alt="Aidgrade-logo" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/157/large/AidGrade-logo.jpg?1370450850" /></a>

We talked a little about her career background and what AidGrade is doing, as well as what career advice she might have for people with similar aims in poverty reduction and international development. 

**Tell us a bit about your background and how you got to your current position.**

I was interested in the idea of “helping as much as I could” from a very early stage. I did my undergraduate degree in philosophy, but realised partway through that this probably wasn’t the best way for me to figure out how to help the world. Not that philosophy isn’t a great way to do this for some people, but personally I thought I could better get this through studying international development. So I did a Masters program in Development Studies at Oxford, which was fantastic. The course is a real mix of different disciplines, which ensures you don’t think too narrowly early on.

I realised I particularly liked the way economists were thinking about issues and the way they arrived at conclusions. I felt like I thought in a similar way, and so this seemed like a good direction for me to go in. So I went to Berkeley to do a PhD in Economics. My goal coming into the program was to get out quickly and go and work for the World Bank.

Once there, I kept looking for good ideas for something that I could do. Eventually AidGrade seemed more and more like it was that thing. I found a great group of people in DC who really helped: we all gelled around this idea and built it up from there.

**What would you say were the key decision points in your career? How did you deal with them?**

Looking back, there were three key decision points: The first, choosing between philosophy, physics and development. The second, whilst I was finishing off my PhD at Berkeley, was deciding whether to go and work for the World Bank. And the third was choosing to start AidGrade.

The first came up when I realised I wanted to move away from philosophy. I wavered between changing to physics rather than development, mostly just because I really like physics, and I do think it’s an important field. But I realised that I was better suited to development, so could personally make more of a difference there. This made the decision fairly straightforward. I would probably be average in physics, so it would be harder to contribute much. In development it also seemed like there was more scope for doing things: there’s a lot of money and interest in the field and the moment, and you can move quite a lot of resources.

The second key decision was whether to go to academia after my PhD or to go and work for the World Bank. To be honest, there wasn’t much chance I wouldn’t have accepted the World Bank offer, and I didn’t examine this decision much. Although the outcome was good, I could have done my homework a lot better; I didn’t know much about the World Bank before joining it. I’d spent one summer in its research division, but the World Bank is divided into research and operations, which are two very different worlds. This wasn’t something I understood at the time.

Deciding to start AidGrade was the third key decision and definitely the most difficult one, because in a sense it was a point of no return. It does a lot of meta-analyses, and if you do meta-analysis, people look at you a bit funny. There is not much prestige in it, as researchers prefer to write the first paper on a topic to get a better publication. You are also suddenly in the thick of great wars between different economists. Further, people doubt your intentions because it is a bit “pop.” In general, there are huge risks in pursuing a venture when it’s hard to get a sense of how well it will work, whether it will be successful or not. I didn’t have much to compare it to, and so not much with which to form beliefs! All that said, I’d gotten to a stage where I wanted to narrow down my options and pick one thing to really push forward, and AidGrade really seemed to be the best option. It’s also not a venture that rules out other things: I can still continue my academic research, for example. I did try to test the water as best I could by getting as much feedback as possible from other people. Talking with people tends to be much more helpful than doing research on your own, although different people always have different incentives, so you have to be wary of this.

**Tell us a bit more about AidGrade. What exactly are you doing, and why?** 

We realised there was this big gap between people who have really studied development economics in depth, and people doing analyses of aid programs. Most of the people who *can* do this kind of analysis don’t want to do it, and those who *want* to do it, sadly aren’t always very good at it. Another thing we noticed is that you can break down the components of a meta-analysis into small chunks, get a lot of people involved, and then do it much more cost-effectively. A lot of people do do meta-analyses - the Cochrane Collaboration are a good example - but the way it’s been done in the past can be problematic and isn’t as efficient as it could be. One group of researchers spends a lot of time gathering papers, screening the papers, and then comes up with an estimate based on this set of papers. But if another set of researchers want to question these results - perhaps because they think they should have used a different set of papers - they have to start the whole practice from scratch.

So what we want to do is get the “superset” of papers people could be interested in when assessing different aid interventions and build a database that anybody could use afterwards. This means you wouldn’t have to keep reinventing the wheel every time you want to do a meta-analysis on a subject: you could just go and use this database. We’re also aiming to code up different variables that people might want to filter on: so if you’re interested in, say, school meals programs in a particular location, for a particular age group of children, you can narrow down the studies to these. You’d also be able to filter on whether the study used particular methods, reported various things, or scores well on various quality characteristics.

**Could you explain a bit more how AidGrade differs from other existing charity evaluators like GiveWell?**

To start with, GiveWell itself doesn’t actually do meta-analyses; they read up on meta-analyses done by others. I think that’s great, but in some subjects, there aren’t existing or up-to-date meta-analyses. And there are flaws in the general approach to looking at past literature. Say I take 10 studies, 7 of which find no effect, 3 find some positive effect, and I conclude there’s not much evidence of any positive effect. Statistically speaking, this isn’t a good way of going about it because it might simply be that those 7 studies didn’t have the right sample size, and if you combined them in a meta-analysis in the right way you’d see a stronger effect.

It’s also difficult to analyse in what context different programs do and do not work: the “average location” doesn’t really exist, so we can’t necessarily say a program has a given effect “in general.” The idea is that our database will allow you to drill down into a bit more detail, do a meta-analysis on any subset of papers, which I think is really important.

I don’t mean to put GiveWell down - I think there are a lot of things they do really well. I just think there is definitely value added by what AidGrade is doing. We’re not a competitive venture in any way: both organisations benefit from each other’s presence in this field.

**Why is it you’re looking at a very broad range of organisations and interventions, as compared to someone like GiveWell who only recommend a very few?**

We don’t really feel comfortable with the idea of recommending a very few organisations or interventions. This is because when you have a great deal of uncertainty about something, you actually do better if you select more options to mitigate your risk. The same reasoning explains why people diversify their own investments: and if you diversify for yourself, you should probably diversify for other people, right? On an individual basis, it maybe doesn’t matter so much: if you have a number of individuals pursuing different things, it probably does balance out in the end across individuals. But whilst we do have some sense of some programs being better than others, and we do want people to be donating to the most effective causes, I feel a great deal of uncertainty remains: enough to make it worth diversifying a bit more.

**That makes sense. But given that we do at least have some evidence of certain causes or programs being more effective than others, isn’t there a risk of diversifying too much?**

I would definitely agree that we should support some programs over others. I wrote up a fuller discussion of the issue [here](http://aideconomics.com/index.php/2013/06/17/how-to-give-under-risk). In particular, I would like to emphasize that given that people do contribute to a wide variety of causes, in effect the status quo is already very diverse and donations could use more direction. I’m happy to talk more about this in a further post or in comments if people have questions.

**How did you decide which topics to focus on initially?**

First, it was important to select topics on which there would actually be an adequate number of studies, so we did some initial searches to whittle down a long list. We’re actually doing an impact evaluation of our own work, so that has also affected how we have selected topics. For the impact evaluation, the most relevant factors that we thought could affect the results of the study were: the number of impact evaluations on each topic; the initial level of public interest in each topic; and the initial level of institutional funding for each topic. We held a public vote and took the winner as a topic for investigation, and the other topics that survived the preliminary searches were matched to each other and then randomized within the pair. The [AidGrade Process Description](http://www.aidgrade.org/methodology/process-map-and-methodology) contains more information about the procedure.

As a general rule, if one is solely seeking to maximize value of each meta-analysis, one should target those areas where there are a lot of studies but limited synthesis of the data, as well as areas which are of high policy importance and which could be changed by new information. (I am actually preparing a document for someone at the World Bank at the moment summarizing the areas where we know the least relative to spending.) We plan to use this kind of targeting more going forward.

**So what are AidGrade’s key aims, in the short term and the more long term?** 

We’re still compiling this database, so that’s a key aim for the short term. We want to eventually have all impact evaluations in international development: there are only several hundred out there really, so I think this is quite plausible as a short term goal, and we should be covering it quite soon.

Beyond that, there are some interesting research questions that can be answered with the same database. Unfortunately, there are large issues of credibility within research, and that’s a field that is really ripe for new work. There are now all these different ventures in this field, but there’s still space here I feel. People are mining their data inappropriately: for example, running millions of regressions, finding something significant in one, and just reporting that one. That’s not how hypothesis testing is supposed to work, so there’s really a problem with that. Then there are all these studies where people have tried to replicate past results and failed. I heard a story about a study a while back where they tried to replicate 45 articles in a journal, and 43 of them couldn’t be replicated. It’s ridiculous. So we’re thinking about how we could potentially move in this direction, in a way that’s constructive and helpful and other people aren’t already doing. There are a few ideas there, but it’s all very tentative at this point, and that’s more of a long-term thing. We’re still largely focusing on getting these impact evaluations in our database.

**What do you think are the biggest limiting factors in fighting global poverty at the moment? Lack of good researchers, lack of funding, lack of good people in policy, or something else?**

It’s not necessarily that there aren’t good researchers, but I guess I feel like the talented researchers don’t necessarily do the research that is important. It’s more of a mismatch in that way. A lot of people who are interested and really want to make a difference don’t actually seem to end up pursuing this. There is a definite need for people who say okay, I’m interested in these subjects, I’m going to undergo lengthy training to understand the issues, write and read academic papers, but then focus on the topics that are most pressing rather than those that are “hot.” I don’t mean to disparage academia, because there are a lot of really fantastic people there, but at the same time, there are all these competing pressures. The talented people need to find ways to avoid those pressures.

There’s also the fraud issue unfortunately: hopefully this can improve with better incentives. And even if researchers are focusing on the important topics, there’s still the issue that you have to be able to convince policy makers, and they don’t have the right incentives either. They can always find someone who calls him or herself an “economist” and will support their views; it’s a very unfortunate situation. There are numerous steps along the way here where these things can go wrong.

**A bit closer to home, what are the biggest limitations AidGrade is facing as an organisation?**

One of the biggest limitations we face is that people don’t naturally care about the fine points of rigorous analysis. It’s not sexy. And we don’t have a big PR movement that makes flamboyant statements or strokes people’s egos to attract media attention. If nobody cares about your results, why bother? That’s a pretty big limitation, though one we hope will be mitigated in the future by the slow but steady turn to data as well as great partnerships and growing publicity. Large institutions also generally see the value in data and in meta-analysis in particular.

Another answer is money. We don’t earn profits, so we need to rely on constant outside funding for our work. Sorry this is such a lame answer to this question, but it’s true – it’s a constraint and we could be doing a lot more. Overall, though, I think we’re doing quite well. As we say on our website, AidGrade isn’t intended to be a cure-all. However, it has a very valuable role to play and one that isn’t currently addressed by any other organization.

**How can people get involved in AidGrade? What are you looking for, what skills and background would you need?** 

It’s all quite open at the moment, there’s a real variety of things we need doing. Because we try to break down the meta-analysis process into individual components, that leads to a wide range of tasks, there’s really something for everybody. If you don’t have a lot of background, you can help screen titles for papers. If you have a bit more sophistication and time and you want to get a bit more in-depth, you can read through some of the academic papers in more detail and help code up the characteristics of the paper. Going further than that, you can help analyse the data. Plus the typical variety of roles you’d find in any organisation: social media, web development, fundraising. There are really many, many roles.

It’s easy for people to get in touch through the website, where there’s a lot more information on all of this than I can describe. If you’re interested, there are some email addresses on the site and some forms: any of those channels will do!

**What do you think are other top jobs in this area?**

It’s a tough question: I think there should be more innovative work. I’m a big fan of all of these innovation competitions and these kinds of things, I think they’re fantastic. I think it’s unlikely the biggest opportunities are in particularly large organisations that have a lot of bureaucracy, unfortunately. When you have a very large organisation which is somewhat ineffective, it’s very entrenched in the culture, but then again it also depends on the individual. 

At the same time, I don’t want to encourage a “too many cooks”-style problem: people always want to go off and start their own idea, which doesn’t always work. But there may still be a lot of low-hanging fruit at the moment. I’ve spent some time in the San Francisco Bay Area and I was quite impressed by some of the ideas coming out of there.

More specifically, I wish there were more advocacy for freer migration. I think that’s an area which is rather under-served compared to the evidence on it.

**To wrap up: what would your biggest pieces of advice be for someone in the early stages of their career passionate about fighting global poverty? What do you wish you’d known?**

At some points, pursuing something just trying to helping others can be a long, hard slog. A lot of people will say what you’re doing is admirable, but at the same time, you’re kind of on your own on this path. There’s not much support, and what you’re trying to do can be quite risky. So I’d just recommend firstly being cautious, but also keeping in mind that it’s OK to fail, and making sure you have a good support system in place.

Aside from that, I would advise trying to learn as much as possible early on about the different areas you could possibly pursue. Originally, I went into the economics PhD because I knew I wanted to be an activist, but I wanted to figure out what I wanted to be an activist for! I think that gaining a lot of knowledge early on is a really good idea. Learning is an ongoing process, but when you’re relatively young is the best time to invest as much as possible in figuring out what to do with the rest of your time. Don’t just jump into something - you’ve got the whole of your life.

One point to push on - It only follows that you should diversify more with your donations in the presence of higher uncertainty if you're risk averse with your donations. But why be risk averse with your personal donations? It's not like we need to have a track record with a minimum level of success, like a big foundation.

Peter Singer gave a TED talk on "The Why and How of Effective Altruism," which you can watch [here](http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism.html), which mentions 80,000 Hours.

It's been interesting to look at people's reactions both on the TED website, and on YouTube. The comments have been better than I expected, and a lot of people have been very enthusiastic, which has been great.

The main criticisms seem to be:
1. Charity starts at home
2. Doing some amount of good is what matters, not trying to maximize
3. It's unfair only to focus on the most cost-effective programs, when there are other causes you could focus on
4. There's too much focus on the symptoms (which charitable donations do) rather than the root causes of global problems
5. Worries about some people (e.g. Gates) doing harm through the way they made their money
6. It's impossible to compare effectiveness across charities because the outcomes are so different
7. You have no reason to be altruistic (and if you're doing it because it makes you feel good, then that's just another form of egoism)

Of course I think that the criticisms are mistaken, but it's good to be aware of where the idea of effective altruism is unintuitive or controversial.

There were also a lot of comments about the pretty inappropriate Rolex advert that follows the talk!

<p>Re: criticisms. I think you/we should be making more effort to clarify how the truth behind the sentiment of objection (1) is compatible with the rational-utilitarian expansion of moral concern. That is, how our prioritising of the very close (family, friends) is compatible with the view that the quite far and the very far are equally entitled to our concern. The failure to do this was one of the weakest parts of Singer’s talk - it introduced the possibility of his appearing impossibly over-demanding, or worse, a moral lunatic.</p>

<p>As another example, in a <a href='http://80000hours.org/blog/227-80-000-hours-in-the-washington-post-our-responses-to-the-coverage'>recent post</a> Ben wrote:</p>

<p>“If we start with our affection for those closest around us and recognize rationally that every human life counts equally, we arrive at the conclusion that the near and the far are equally important and equally deserving of our concern.”</p>

<p>I know Ben's no a moral lunatic - quite the opposite - but I do think this statement is misleading, and vulnerable to caricature.

At 80,000 Hours we have been looking into which research questions are most important or prone to neglect. As part of that, I was recently lucky enough to have dinner with Iain Chalmers, one of the founders of the Cochrane Collaborations. He let me know about this helpful summary of reasons to think most clinical research is predictably wasteful:

> “Worldwide, over US$100 billion is invested every year in supporting biomedical research, which results in an estimated 1 million research publications per year
>
>...
>
>A recently updated systematic review of 79 follow-up studies of research reported in abstracts estimated the rate of publication of full reports after 9 years to be only 53%.
>
>...
>
>An eﬃcient system of research should address health problems of importance to populations and the interventions and outcomes considered important by patients and clinicians. However, public funding of research is correlated only modestly with disease burden, if at all. Within speciﬁc health problems there is little research on the extent to which questions addressed by researchers match questions of relevance to patients and clinicians. In an analysis of 334 studies, only nine compared researchers’ priorities with those of patients or clinicians. The ﬁndings of these studies have revealed some dramatic mismatches. For example, the research priorities of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and the clinicians looking after them favoured more rigorous evaluation of physiotherapy and surgery, and assessment of educational and coping strategies. Only 9% of patients wanted more research on drugs, yet over 80% of randomised controlled trials in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were drug evaluations. This interest in non-drug interventions in users of research results is reﬂected in the fact that the vast majority of the most frequently consulted Cochrane reviews are about non-drug forms of treatment.
>
>…
>
>New research should not be done unless, at the time it is initiated, the questions it proposes to address cannot be answered satisfactorily with existing evidence. Many researchers do not do this—for example, Cooper and colleagues found that only 11 of 24 responding authors of trial reports that had been added to existing systematic reviews were even aware of the relevant reviews when they designed their new studies.
>
>…
>
>New research is also too often wasteful because of inadequate attention to other important elements of study design or conduct. For example, in a sample of 234 clinical trials reported in the major general medical journals, concealment of treatment allocation was often inadequate (18%) or unclear (26%). In an assessment of 487 primary studies of diagnostic accuracy, 20% used diﬀerent reference standards for positive and negative tests, thus overestimating accuracy, and only 17% used double-blind reading of tests.
>
>…
>
>More generally, studies with results that are disappointing are less likely to be published promptly, more likely to be published in grey literature, and less likely to proceed from abstracts to full reports. The problem of biased under-reporting of research results mainly from decisions taken by research sponsors and researchers, not from journal editors rejecting submitted reports. Over the past decade, biased under-reporting and over-reporting of research have been increasingly acknowledged as unacceptable, both on scientiﬁc and on ethical grounds.
>
>…
>
>Although their quality has improved, reports of research remain much less useful than they should be. Sometimes this is because of frankly biased reporting—eg, adverse eﬀects of treatments are suppressed, the choice of primary outcomes is changed between trial protocol and trial reports, and the way data are presented does not allow comparisons with other, related studies. But even when trial reports are free of such biases, there are many respects in which reports could be made more useful to clinicians, patients, and researchers. We select here just two of these. First, if clinicians are to be expected to implement treatments that have been shown in research to be useful, they need adequate descriptions of the interventions assessed, especially when these are non-drug interventions, such as setting up a stroke unit, oﬀering a low fat diet, or giving smoking cessation advice. Adequate information on interventions is available in around 60% of reports of clinical trials; yet, by checking references, contacting authors, and doing additional searches, it is possible to increase to 90% the proportion of trials for which adequate information could be made available.
>
>…
>
>Although some waste in the production and reporting of research evidence is inevitable and bearable, we were surprised by the levels of waste suggested in the evidence we have pieced together. Since research must pass through all four stages shown in the ﬁgure, the waste is cumulative. If the losses estimated in the ﬁgure apply more generally, then the roughly 50% loss at stages 2, 3, and 4 would lead to a greater than 85% loss, which implies that the dividends from tens of billions of dollars of investment in research are lost every year because of correctable problems.”

His assessment was that the research profession could not be expected to fix up these problems internally, as it had not done so already despite widespread knowledge of these problems, and had no additional incentive to do so now. It needs external intervention and some options are proposed in the paper.

There is a precedent for this. The US recently joined a growing list of countries who have helped their researchers coordinate to weaken the academic publishing racket, by insisting that publicly-funded research be free and openly available within a year. So long as academics are permitted to publish publicly-funded research in pay-for-access journals, established and prestigious journals can earn big rents by selling their prestige to researchers – to help them advance their careers – in exchange for copyright on their publicly-funded research. Now that researchers aren’t permitted to sell that copyright, an individual who would refuse to do so out of principle won’t be outcompeted by less scrupulous colleagues.

Likewise, rules that require everyone receiving public money to do the public-spirited thing, for instance by checking for systematic reviews, publishing null results,  pre-registering their approach to data analysis, opening their data to scrutiny by colleagues, and so on, would make it harder for unscrupulous researchers to get ahead with corner-cutting or worse chicanery.

When people say that time is money, they mostly mean that you can earn money with your time. But it works both ways.  In a previous post I discussed [how we can spend money on a virtual assistant to save time](http://80000hours.org/blog/127-spending-money-to-save-time-virtual-assistance).  Here I will discuss some ways that you can spend money on goods or services to save you time. 


##Food
I have found a few cheap places to eat in my neighbourhood but my favourite is our college hall.  The student cafeteria is an ideal location to eat as food is generally cheaper than elsewhere, and cooking costs are usually subsidised or paid entirely by the college.  I try and arrange all of my meetings during meal times as a form of multi-tasking, and my college cafeteria is my favourite location.  You’ll want to factor in travel times to and from your local eatery when doing this calculation, but for me it is well worth doing.  

##Shopping
When I go do a weekly shop it takes me about an hour all-told.  I am about to trial using a shopping delivery service such as tesco.com to do the shopping for me.  There is an initial setup cost associated with selecting which types of items I like, for example which type of muesli I buy, and saving them in the system.  But once I have done this, I can save time each week by taking a photo of my shopping list and sending it to my virtual assistant to order online for me.  I have not tried this yet, but I’ll let you know how it goes.  

##Going digital
I have spent money on a number of services that have allowed me to go digital, saving me time and hassle.  Everything I have here is worth doing in my opinion, but are not that big time savers relative to many of the other items listed here.  Some examples are below:

- Movie rental – I use [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/uk/itunes/) to rent or buy movies rather than going to a video store.  
- Digitise your life – I use [Evernote](http://evernote.com) to eliminate most paper from my life.  Most of my formerly paper files are now stored on Evernote.  I take photos of them, and uses tags and optical character recognition for each searching.  This saves me time in searching through lab books, note pads, and files.  An even better solution is to make notes digitally in the first place, but I still find myself wedded, perhaps irrationally, to pen and paper for many things.  The main benefit of using Evernote for me is to make me footloose, allowing me to have my office with me anytime anywhere, turning more travel time into productive time.  It also allows me to share my files with my virtual assistant, allowing me to delegate more.  
- Good backup – The time expense of losing all your files is quite large, not to mention the associated psychological stress.  Get yourself a good backup system.  I use a 1Tb hard disk in [Raid-1 configuration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels) (so that it is actually functions as a 500Gb hard disk with redundancy in case one of its two independent disks fail).  To avoid the hassle of backing up regularly I use [Time Machine](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1427), which does it automatically for me.  I locate my hard disk in my office, so that whenever I go there I hook up to it when I hook of up for power and internet.   

##Graphic design and presentations
There are now professional services available that let you send edits on a print out of a document or presentation to a virtual business assistant to put the edits into the electronic copy.  For example, it is much quicker to make edits to a “deck” of printed out powerpoint slides and scan them to an assistant than it is to make the edits yourself.  

When I am making a powerpoint that includes a complex diagram, I often sketch the diagram on a whiteboard or on paper and send it to a graphic designer to work up into an electronic diagram rather than doing it myself.  

##Travel
There are a number of ways that you can spend money to gain time when faced with a situation in which you must travel.  

Let us begin with a simplified assumption that the benefits gained from your time while traveling is zero.  This makes the calculation quite simple: just calculate the cost saving per hour of time saved in travelling via a faster route.  

A more realistic calculation factors in the value of your time while you are travelling.  If you sitting down on a train or bus and can use your laptop, then the benefits gained from time spent travelling is close to the benefit gained from a spare hour, assuming that you have things to do on your laptop that you would otherwise do in your spare time.  

You can increase the benefits gained from time while travelling by doing something that you would have had to do anyway.  For example, I use the [iPhone app “pocket”](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pocket-formerly-read-it-later/id309601447?mt=8) (formerly “Read it later”) to do reading on public transport that I would normally do at my computer.  You could be reading this very blog post, or any other website for that matter, on the bus or while waiting for a train, instead of at your computer.  

This means that if you can cycle somewhere in 20 minutes, it might actually be worth your time to take the bus even if it takes 40 minutes, as you could work on the bus.  This is of course complicated by waiting times, and the enjoyment and fitness benefits of cycling, but I’ll let you figure those out.  

##Summary
So there were a few ways to spend money to save time. Whether or not you should be using these techniques depends on the marginal value of your time, but I’m saving that for another post.  If you have any other ideas on how people can spend money to save time using goods and services please do let us know below.  ]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier></dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2013-01-11 22:52:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>827</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Pablo Stafforini</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>pablo@stafforini.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/pablo-stafforini</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-01-13 23:24:33</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<blockquote>I am about to trial using a shopping delivery service such as tesco.com to do the shopping for me.

However, I think an important part of the equation is "what will you do with the time you are saving?" One can argue that going to the supermarket and doing your own shopping has no intrinsic value, but someone who works alone with little social contact may feel less isolated (and thus gain value) from a trip to the supermarket rather than having food delivered. 

Idle, reflective time has value. When I travel, I often purposefully leave my laptop or book in my bag and spend hours simply thinking and reflecting rather than doing work or reading. 

Learning new skills, such as how to edit graphics in a PowerPoint file, may have value as well. If it's something you have no aptitude for and no desire to learn then it's fine to pass that kind of work to an assistant, but it's worth contemplating whether this is a skill that might come in handy during times when an assistant may not be available. We delegate many tasks to experts, and rightly so (I wouldn't want to try doing surgery on myself), but personally I find value in acquiring new skills that may come in handy throughout my career. ]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>How to choose a degree - putting it all together</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/145-how-to-choose-a-degree-putting-it-all-together</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s time. This is where you pull together [all](/blog/142-how-to-choose-a-degree-for-earning-to-give-and-research) the [information](/blog/143-how-to-choose-a-degree-what-do-employers-want) you have [assembled](/blog/144-10-steps-to-choosing-your-degree) to work out what you will be most likely to succeed at and which degrees will set you up to do good.

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/81/original/assembly.jpg?1358361141'><img alt="Assembly" class="image large" align="center" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/81/medium/assembly.jpg?1358361141" /></a> 

Working out exactly how to bring together all of the different bits of information is hard and there is no formula for it. Talking through this with someone you trust to make good decisions is often useful. Look especially for people who gave you advice before that turned out to be good. But remember that they might be biased. If they disagree with you about something ask yourself why. Do they have information you don’t have? Maybe they have valuable life experience you’re missing, don’t neglect that. Or they might just care about different things because they are a different person.

As always, respect the opinions of others and try to understand why they believe what they do. Then try to see what your beliefs are once you’ve taken account of the reasons they had.
But even though there’s no formula, I’m going to suggest a way to [use a scoring system to structure your thoughts.](http://80000hours.org/blog/117-a-formula-for-the-perfect-job) The results of this scoring system won’t always be better than your gut instinct. But using a system helps you make sure you don’t miss some of your evidence and makes it more likely that you treat your evidence consistently. 

It’s time for a new table. For each degree course you’re still considering, you’ll want a score to reflect the following:
- How qualified am I?
- How passionate am I?
- How good are my scores (e.g. relevant tests and GCSEs, AS)?
- How well do my parents/teachers think I’ll do?
- How well does the university think I’ll do?
- How well do I think I’ll do?
- What intelligence does the degree signal?
- What is the average salary of graduates?
- What percentage of graduates are using their degree after 6m?
- How flexible is the degree?
- Does the degree lead easily to careers that make a difference?

Now you need to assign a score for each degree for each point. This is tricky, but it doesn’t matter too much what your scoring looks like. I could go into details about exactly what sorts of distributions you should use, but it wouldn’t help too much. I’d be tempted to assign each a score between 1 and 5 (you don’t need more levels). In each case, a 3 means “this aspect of the degree gives me no reason to prefer it or not”. A 2 means “this is a reason to not choose the degree”. 1 means “this is a strong reason to not choose this degree”. 4 and 5 are the mirror of 1 and 2.

Now you want to weight each of your points. For example, I might clump the first 6 together and say they are all indicators that I’ll be successful at the degree. The next three are indicators of how much the degree is worth to society. The last two are indicators of how good the degree is for an ethical career. Suppose I care about as much about all three of those ideas. Then I should weigh each of the second clump twice as heavily as each of the first six (so that the total weight of each clump is the same). And each of the third clump should be worth three times as much as each of the first 6. So I add up the first 6, plus two times each of the next three, plus three times each of the next two. That gives me a total score for each subject.

Then I would look at all those scores and see how they strike me. Odds are that the scores do represent what’s been unfolding in your head as your best choice. But maybe they don’t. If they don’t, try to work out why. Is it, perhaps, because you actually value something more highly than it is represented in your formula? Is it because the formula only lets you go up to 5, and you think one of the reasons was so strong it should be a 6 or a 7? Whatever the issue, don’t necessarily just go with your table. The table is a tool for thinking things through carefully, it doesn’t always give the right answer.

Also remember that you should feel free to add in your own indicators if there’s something that applies to you that I’ve left out. And, if you found this useful, share it with friends who are making similar decisions.

Using these 10 steps you should be able to systematically work out which degrees you are likely to do well at. Doing well at a degree is an important step towards doing good after your degree. It is probably more important than doing a degree that seems to lead directly towards making a difference.

Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works 10%  more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former.

To have impact you need to choose the right career. But that’s not all. If you can build your knowledge and productivity faster than everyone else in your field then you’ll rise to the top and have much more impact. So how can you do this?

<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/anandham/4499539060/'><img alt="Butterfly_metamorphosis" class="image medium" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/127/medium/Butterfly_metamorphosis.jpg?1367168209" /></a>

Obviously you need to build skills, but which skills should you build first? Conventional careers advice suggests that you should work out which skills you need for your chosen career and then learn them. But it’s far better to start by building skills that make you more able to build other skills. So productivity and learning techniques are where you should start. That way you get compounding benefits for everything else you do (including more skill building), even if you end up changing your career plans.

So which productivity techniques are the best? It’s easy to spend ages reading productivity advice on the internet - I did that for years with little improvement. But most of the stuff you find isn’t evidence based and rarely gives you clear steps to follow. For me a handful of actionable, evidence-based techniques helped turn things around. Using two techniques I talk about in this blog series (commitment devices and task management) I went from procrastinating and being disorganised to being dependably productive and much less stressed. The other techniques I describe are also beginning to make me more productive and many people on the 80,000 Hours team have found them helpful too. And because these techniques are supported by evidence rather than intuition and individual experience, they should help you too.

In the rest of the series I’ll explore four key productivity techniques, and briefly summarise several other useful techniques and habits. I’d love to hear from you if you try out any of the techniques - just leave a comment on one of the posts saying how it went and whether or not you found the technique helpful.

We saw that having paid for something distorts how you think about it later on.

This is a very common experience in career decisions. You might be in a degree course you don’t want to be on, or climbing the ladder in a company you aren’t sure about, or find out that the dream job you’ve spent years working for isn’t as good as expected. It is only by forgetting these sunk costs that you can make the right career decisions and have as much impact as you can.

If you find yourself in this situation what can you do?

##Rejecting sunk costs

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/50/original/Lee.jpg?1351008572'><img alt="Mark Lee" class="image small" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/50/small/Lee.jpg?1351008572" /></a>

[Mark Lee](http://80000hours.org/members/mark-lee) was working to become a [high-impact philosopher](http://80000hours.org/blog/46-how-to-be-a-high-impact-philosopher), he already had a batchelor’s degree and was working towards a PhD. Then he learned about [earning to give](http://80000hours.org/earning-to-give).

On paper Mark was faced with an tricky decision: what would do more good, doing philosophy, or training as a lawyer and doing earning to give? It's a tricky decision, but it's at least possible to think through the different ways those careers will do good, and to estimate how much good they are likely to do.

In practice that decision was much harder. Those years of work getting his degree were a huge cost. To abandon that work (letting that work be in vain) would be painful for most people, which would make it hard to reliably make the right decision. **If you’ve already worked to get something, you’ll think it was a better choice than if you hadn’t.** [^1]

How could Mark have overcome this bias and make a rational decision about his future career?

##Fighting the sunk cost bias

Correcting this bias is hard, but it can be done. If you follow this simple 3 step process the evidence suggests you will find it easier to make rational decisions.

###1) Present: Assess your current situation without talking about the past.

Talk through what you have now, all the knowledge, all the qualifications, all the things that give you access to something else. But don’t think about how you got them, pretend that process was just an accident.

###2) Future: Talk about the future costs/benefits of your options.

Once you know where you are talk about where you can go. Make a list of the costs **from now on** of each option, and a list of all the benefits **from now on** of each option.[^2]

###3) Justify: Explain these future cost/benefits to someone else and justify your decision to them

Get someone else, like an 80,000 hours advisor, to talk through the decision with you. If you understand sunk costs then you are likely to find it hard to justify biased decisions to someone else.[^3]

So for Mark’s decision the process could look something like this:

* Step 1:
Mark can imagine that he woke up one morning to find that some martians had hacked the university records to award him a fake degree and then performed brain surgery to give him lots of extra philosophy knowledge.
* Step 2:
Mark lists how much extra work he would have to do to finish his PhD and compares it to the work he would have to do to train as a lawyer. He then lists how much good he could do as a philosopher and how much good he could do as a lawyer.
* Step 3:
It is important for Mark to talk over these estimates with someone else. So he talks to a friend about each step of reasoning.

In the end Mark concluded he would do more good as a lawyer.

##But the story doesn’t end there.

Some years after starting law school Mark reassessed what was lacking in the field of effective altruism. He decided that the building an effective recruitment network was more urgent than just raising money. So he was faced with yet another sunk cost decision. Could he abandon his law school training and start all over a third time?

The sunk cost bias is powerful, but it can be overcome. Mark went on to found [THINK](http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/) in August 2012.




##Question to think about:

What have you invested a lot of time/money into? Are you sure that carrying on with it is the right choice? Give an example of where you’ve overcome the sunk cost bias in comments.

I've heard there's evidence out there that changing companies, even when you get an immediate, significant salary bump, has considerable negative impacts on lifetime income.  "Considerable" just means we should consider them, yeah?

So far, I've found some rather shoddy evidence, but a place to start:

"Many career development specialists advise against changing jobs without a pay raise of 30 percent or more, especially if it involves relocation."

Given that a career change may come in place of a raise, let's deduct, say, 10% from that and say that, when dispassionately considering future outcomes, keep in mind that the world's not so dispassionate - others will wonder about the sunk costs, perhaps.  On the other hand,

"After the first few years in the workforce, when people are expected to change jobs more frequently to find the right fit, Fuller found that each job change reduced the worker's wages by a little more than one per cent."

This implies the cost of switching may be much lower, around 1%, and there's not so much cost when you're young (which it looks like lots of folks here are).  The 1-20% spread indicates, perhaps, some research may be helpful - if it is 20% it'd be good to know.

But yeah, Mark Lee's got some stones.

###Our project to find research that makes the world a better place

</br>

<center><a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/43/original/laboratory_beaker.jpg?1349289198'><img alt="Laboratory_beaker" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/43/medium/laboratory_beaker.jpg?1349289198" /></a> </center>

Like many new academics, you want to do important research; research that makes the world a better place. The problem is there’s virtually no guidance out there. All you can do is ask experts in specific fields, while there’s no-one providing an overview of which areas might be best.

We want to change this. We’re building a resource of strategies and ideas for finding high impact research questions, as well as practical information about how to get involved with them. If you would like to get involved, [contact us!](/contact-us)

In this post, we take a first step and **explore how to find research questions that need your talent.**

* * *

##Introduction##
A high impact research question has three characteristics:

1. **It’s important**: If we make progress, then the world will become a better place.
2. **It needs talent**: If more people work on it, then more progress will be made. And in particular...
3. **It needs your talent**: If you work on it, then more progress will be made

A good research question needs to be both important and in need of more researchers. Building a perpetual motion machine is extremely important - if we could do it, then we’d solve our energy problems - but we have good reason to think it’s impossible, so it’s not worth working on. Similarly, a problem can be important but already hold the attention of many extremely talented researchers, meaning your extra efforts won’t go very far.

Instead, we want to find questions that are important and where one extra person’s efforts can go a long way. What matters is the importance of the problem weighted by the extent to which you can make a difference to the problem.

Finding these questions, however, is difficult. Often, the only way to identify a particularly promising research question is to be an expert in that field! That’s because (when researchers are doing their jobs), they will be taking the most promising opportunities already. The only way for you to have more impact than the average is *to have more informed views about what’s important to work on*.

Nevertheless, it seems that there are some types of question that tend to get unfairly neglected. So, for someone who prioritises impact, there are special opportunities to uncover. What follows is one way to start narrowing down the huge range of options available.

* * *

##Rules of thumb for finding talent gaps##

<br>

We suspect that the easiest first step is to look for the plausibly important research questions that are short on talent. (This is similar to Givewell’s [new process](http://blog.givewell.org/2012/09/13/updated-thoughts-on-our-key-criteria/) for finding funding opportunities.) After we’ve got a short-list, the next step will be to make rough estimates of importance.

Often there’s not many people working on a research question, but there’s also a good reason why. True talent gaps arise when people don’t work on a question *for bad reasons.* Often, they arise because what’s best from a selfish point of view for individuals or organisations diverges from what makes the most impact. This leads to a shortage of researchers going into that field. Individual researchers often optimise their careers in terms of what has the most academic prestige, rather than the most impact. Prestige is often well correlated with impact, but sometimes it diverges. The research agenda is also set by governments and markets, which sometimes fail to focus on making the world a better place. We can probe areas where there’s likely to be a divergence in order to find high impact opportunities.

Here’s some common things to look for (which also apply to finding good [causes](/causes) in general):

###There’s no money in it
This can be because the problem mostly affects poor people, people who haven’t been born yet, non-humans, or involves [public goods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good). It means that there’s little incentive for businesses to do research on this problem.

###The political incentives are missing
This can happen when the problem hurts poor or otherwise marginalised people, people who tend not to organise politically, people in other countries, people who haven’t been born yet, or non-humans. This means there’s no incentive for governments to tackle this problem.

###It’s low visibility
If people don’t know about a problem (or a solution) then they can’t work on it. This happens often with new solutions/problems, complicated issues, issues that affect poor or otherwise marginalised people, or issues with some taboo attached.

###There is some aspect of human irrationality that makes it unattractive
People have systematic biases that sometimes stop them working on important issues. This is particularly bad for problems that are hard to visualise, that are very unlikely, or that affect huge numbers of people.

###It’s low status
Some research fields are, fairly or unfairly, less respected. This might be because a field is new or weird. In research, subjects that involve a lot of maths and theoretical work are often regarded as high status. It’s often seen as low-status for a field to be ‘too applied.’ This means that people with strong, theoretical skills can often have more impact by switching into more practical areas.


Some other good rules of thumb:

###Work in newer fields
The number of important discoveries in a field generally increases more slowly than the amount of time invested. This is because the first scientists in an area take the low hanging fruit in terms of impact, and it gets harder and harder from there. Why do scientists not fully take this into account? A major reason is that new fields tend to lack prestige until useful discoveries have been made, so it’s another example of the ‘low status’ rule of thumb. At the same time, it seems possible to keep producing academically impressive work in mature fields (e.g. by doing ever more complex theoretical work) that don’t have as much practical impact as the initial breakthroughs.

In addition, it’s difficult to change field during a career, leading to too many people working on old fields. Linked to this, there could be herding effects. When uncertain about what to do, people look to what others are doing and go with that (obeying the [social proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof) principle). 

This all suggests that if two fields are equally important, then the newer one is in greater need of more talent.


###Work on really giant problems that are in the process of getting solved
Even if people know about a problem and spend lots of resources working on it, the problem may be so huge that you can spend even more. These opportunities can exist for a while despite an area being ‘hot’ because it can take decades to shift new researchers into an area. For instance, there’s lots of information on global health and powerful funders care about it, but the problem is so huge that there is still space to improve things in key areas such as malaria nets and deworming.


###Work on questions that don’t fit neatly into an academic field
If a question doesn’t fit neatly into an academic field, then our existing institutions may tend to under-serve it. New fields and heavily interdisciplinary problems can fall into this category. They can also arise when a topic requires different skills from what’s normal in the discipline. For instance, population ethics belongs to ethics, but it’s much more ‘mathsy’ than what ethicists normally work on.


When we’ve found a potential talent gap, it’s good to check whether this gap exists for a good reason. Ask:

###Is there enough funding?
If there’s not enough funding to divert into this field, then it’s going to be difficult to build your career there. This could be an opportunity for [Earning to Give](/earning-to-give) instead. Or alternatively, you may need to further the research question more indirectly, by working on something related first to build up prestige, then later transferring funding into this area.


###Is the problem intractable?
People might be avoiding this problem because it’s just extremely difficult. Or perhaps progress isn’t possible at all. Ask yourself, ‘if there were progress on this problem, how would we know?’

* * *

##Needs your talent

<br>

Now we should have some ideas for research questions that are talent limited in general. The next step is to think which might be particularly in need of *your* talent.

Research impact is in the tails. The [top 0.1% of papers gets 1000 citations](http://80000hours.org/blog/65-should-you-go-into-research-part-1) compared to the median of about one. This means that your potential for research impact comes mostly from your chances of creating top work in the field.

This means you need to position yourself in fields where you maximise your chances of producing top work. If you don’t know which field is more important, by switching from one in which you’re a median researcher to one in which you’re near the top 10%, you could easily increase your expected impact more than 10 times.

If you position yourself in a field that has a big talent gap, you’ve already done a lot to maximise your chances of producing top work. But what else can you do?


###Bring new skills or a new perspective to an important area
Progress often comes in science from bringing the techniques and insights of one field into another. For instance, [Kahneman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman) started a revolution in economics by applying findings in psychology to it.

Even a well-studied question can benefit from fresh thinking. Quite often by reading inside a different field, new approaches and methods can be applied to another area, with interesting results. A new technology might be waiting to applied, very usefully, to an old field. Cross-over is an obvious approach but is uncommonly used because researchers tend to be immersed in their own particular microcosmic subject.


###Look for areas where you’re better
It's easy to be a [overconfident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconfidence_effect), so look for objective clues that you’re better than the average researcher in the field.

* * *

##What’s next?

<br>

We need your help to help you!

The next step is to go and find these questions. We’ve got some [vague ideas](/promising-research-questions), but there’s a huge amount still to do. If you know anyone with thoughts on where talent gaps might lie, ask them about it, and send the results to careers@80000hours.org. We’ll put them in our new list of ideas and share them with others.

If you’d like to talk about applying these ideas to your own career, [chat to our advisers](http://80000hours.org/request-a-career-advice-session).

My guess is that a very large number of people interested in 80,000 Hours are those who have a high probability of going into research, so I think that devoting lots of 80,000 Hours' resources to this Super-Meta area could be seriously impactful. Super-Meta research like this fits most of the Rules of Thumb for impactful research you outline above, after all! Plus posts like these and Will Crouch's on high-impact philosophy research may serve to bring more existing academics into the community and cause them to think about this stuff more consciously/carefully. Since academics are some of the most rational people out there (one hopes), this might actually have a pretty positive effect how they decide what to work on.

There were a lot of caveats. The job has to earn more than you could have made otherwise to make up for the marginal harm you do by taking it. But for a competitive job market in a mainstream job, that marginal harm is often much smaller than the total harm caused by the job.

At this point, one might raise a second objection – this is a classic collective action problem in which the ‘best option’ for an individual is much worse than the result of longer term co-ordination. [The Prisoner's Dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) and [The Tragedy of the Commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) are classic examples.

Here’s how that might go. Let’s consider the pool of young effective altruist (EA) graduates entering the job market and considering professional philanthropy. Suppose that their highest earning job opportunity is in some industry which they all agree is harmful. Each young graduate apparently
believes:

1. If I enter the harmful industry, the harm I cause (due to the reasoning about replaceability in the [previous post]( http://80000hours.org/blog/35-the-replaceability-effect-working-in-unethical-industries-part-1)) will be much smaller (1) than the good I can do through my
philanthropy

2. The industry is harmful, so it would be better if all of us didn’t work in the industry

Since each young graduate believes (1), they all choose to take the job in the harmful industry and pursue professional philanthropy. But each young graduate also believes that this outcome – where they all work in the harmful industry – is not the ideal outcome. By thinking about how to individually make the most difference, we seem to have ended up in a situation that everyone agrees is not best! This problem extends beyond professional philanthropy – it could apply to all sorts of reasoning we do at 80,000 Hours. What has gone wrong?

I think this story is only convincing because we treat all the young graduates as making a simultaneous decision about whether to enter the harmful industry. In effect, we’re ignoring the possibility for communication between the EA job seekers.

In reality, what would happen? Each young EA would take account of how many other EAs had entered or were planning to enter the industry already. Over a period of years, as more and more EAs become professional philanthropists, it would become less and less good to enter the industry. This is because as the proportion of EAs in the industry increases, the average amount donated by each person in the industry would rise, so each new EA would make less difference. Moreover, the easy opportunities to make the industry less harmful would be taken by other EAs, so the harm done
by entering the industry would get larger and larger. Eventually, it would no longer be best to pursue professional philanthropy in that industry. If each EA does their job, then over time we’ll move towards having just the right proportion of EAs working in the harmful industry.

This process could be accelerated by coordination mechanisms like the 80,000 Hours network. 80,000 Hours can do the work of each individual EA by keeping track of how many people are going into the harmful industries.

So, the truth in the objection is that you need to pay attention to what other EAs are doing. But it doesn’t mean that we should always avoid working in harmful industries, or thinking in general about how to individually make the most difference.

(1) Note that we’re not saying the harm done is ‘negligible’ or ‘zero’. We can also construct puzzle cases were each individual apparently makes no difference, but it adds up to a really bad outcome if everyone does the same thing.

There's a little shortcut going on with the "average amount donated". If you're replacing someone, then you care about the expected donation of the person you replace. If the average donated goes up, then the expected donation replaced is higher, so the difference you make is smaller.

You're right that, as the easy steps are taken, merely participating in the industry starts to carry less harm. But there are also fewer opportunities to improve the whole system by participating in it. It depends on your mindset - are you looking for a job where you won't hurt anyone? Or are you looking for an opportunity to shake things up for the better?]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>445</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>M Webb</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>michaelwebb@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-07-29 19:23:38</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[(1) Thanks for explaining! I think it's important to spell out replaceability arguments in articles on this site, or at least to reference the term at the relevant point. Thinking within that model is second nature presumably only for those working directly on this stuff.

(2) That said, I still think there's a problem with the argument. Let's suppose we eventually get to some EA-utopia in which a majority of, say, Goldman applicants are aspiring EAs. Suppose you are considering working at The Goldman Sachs yourself. For simplicity, assume GS applicants are either EAs, and will give away significant sums to effective organisations, or non-EAs, who, if they give at all, will give much less to less effective organisations. (This seems a very plausible assumption.) Let's say that 50% of entry-level GS applicants are EAs. If you successfully apply, there is a 50% chance you will replace an EA. Would the "difference you make" in that case be near-zero? No! Because the person you replace, being an EA, will most likely go to work at Morgan Stanley, and, indeed, *will still be an EA*. Moreover, as you trace the downwards chain, the probability that you eventually replace a non-EA approaches one. Thus, the expected net increase in all donations as a result of your getting that job is pretty close to the amount you yourself will donate. Right?

(3) So just to be clear, are you saying that there being "fewer opportunities to improve the whole system by participating in it" entails that the harm done by such participation gets "larger and larger"? If so, I'm afraid I still don't quite understand!

(4) (FWIW, I think that "fixing" the banking industry is not going to be done by banks. This is because such fixing meas lower profits, and even if EAs captured the senior management of banks they would be chucked out by boards seeking to protect shareholder value. Lawmakers and regulators are the ones who will do the shaking up, if any. When they do, it could have quite a profound impact on wages: see the two minutes of this video [http://bit.ly/MT5uYB] starting at 49:40, and page 44 of [http://bit.ly/OvR4Lp], which is the presentation I did with Jon Moynihan earlier this year.)]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>448</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Joe</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>hkrobinson123@hotmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-07-30 03:04:09</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm unsure about the replace-ability of these jobs.. As a entry-level member of the finance industry, I don't think the number of jobs is "set." It seems to me like it is determined by how many interested applicants the company is interested in also! Do you have any reasoning behind this claim?

I would also say that if you really want to make the big money in this industry (as seems to be the EA goal), it involves ingenuity and leadership to get to those roles. Many people leave IB or S&T, or stagnate, and never truly bring in the money more than other careers. Point being, if we can assume you're talented and driven enough to do well enough to excel, you will in a sense "expand" the industry, a negative effect that doesn't seem accounted for.

Why is the average amount donated by each person in some industry a relevant metric? The last EA to enter an industry makes precisely as much difference as the first, assuming they give equal amounts to equally effective causes with constant marginal returns.

"Moreover, the easy opportunities to make the industry less harmful would be taken by other EAs, so the harm done by entering the industry would get larger and larger."

Once the opportunities to make the industry less harmful have been taken, surely by that very assumption the harm done by entering the industry is now smaller, rather than larger, than before?]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>447</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Benjamin Todd</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>benjamin.john.todd@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/benjamin-todd</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-07-29 23:08:13</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Mike, on the second point in your first post, I was thinking of a model in which you believe that some harm-producing industry produces two types of harm (i) avoidable (ii) unavoidable.

If an EA enters the industry, however, then they can reduce the avoidable harms. If the EA would have been replaced by a non-ethically motivated person, then the EA makes a positive difference. As the fraction of EAs in the industry increases, then the probability of displacing a non-ethically motivated person decreases, so it becomes harder and harder to make a positive difference insofar as your work in that industry goes. So, the expected benefit of entering the industry as an EA goes down.

Want to really add value and innovate in international development? AidGrade, a fantastic new organisation with precisely this aim, is currently hiring. For more information about AidGrade, see their [website](http://www.aidgrade.org/) and [my recent interview with their founder, Eva Vivalt](http://80000hours.org/blog/).

If making a huge difference using your quantitative skills sounds like something you're interested in, read on for a full description from Eva of what AidGrade are looking for and offers.

***

#Why work with AidGrade?

What's different about AidGrade?

First, we have a high quantitative standard. Here you will find a very high level of maturity about research that you would not often find outside of academia. We focus on being right.

Second, as we are a small organization, you would immediately have a lot of responsibility. This is your organization to build. You really have an immense opportunity here if you have the enthusiasm and skill to seize it.

Third, we're kind of awesome. What we're creating here is new, unique and useful, and the people who have coalesced around this goal are truly wonderful people. There are some other places like that in the world, but not many.



#What are we looking for?

There are two kinds of people we are looking for.

First, we are looking for people to assist with our meta-analyses and quantitative work. These people should ideally have experience with impact evaluations and quantitative methods and be able to get stuck in quickly. These can be shorter-term positions, though those who can work for longer are more valuable to us. We provide additional training and mentoring for those who can commit to longer periods of time.

Second, we are looking for people to grow the organization. We have good work to do and we need to find the resources to do it. We also need to communicate clearly so that our research findings can have more of an effect. Leadership skills and passion are key here.

As we are a small organization, you have the opportunity to shine. We only take people who can actively contribute and be an integral part of the organization.



#How can you help, on the margin, through this job?

Relatively few people have both the interest and the skill to do this kind of work. There are so few people who can do a good job here that you would make a big difference on the margin.



#What's in it for you:

* Knowing you are actively solving a problem in development that needs your help
* The opportunity to carve your own place within international development
* A great career trajectory
* A learning environment
* Fantastic peers
* Recognition

Finally, this isn't talked about much, but... support. If you come here and do a good job I will personally help you however I can. Often what helps in life is having a supporter, someone in your corner who will fight for you, and there's usually no way to know in advance if the people you'll work with are those kinds of people. I'd like to signal that, for my part, I am.

If you'd like to learn more, please send us an e-mail at info@aidgrade.org stating your goals and attaching a CV. We are currently doing a round of recruitment with a deadline of July 1 and you can read more about us on our [blog)](http://www.aidgrade.org/blog).]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>å</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2013-06-21 15:49:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status></item><item><title>Our research on how to find a job you love</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/134-our-research-on-how-to-find-a-job-you-love</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[Many people aren’t as satisfied as they could be with their careers. This is a big problem: not only is the person less happy, they also end up making less difference in society. The even bigger problem is that people don’t seem to know what to do about this - how to find a job that they’ll find satisfying. There’s a lot of psychology research on happiness that could be really useful, but people don’t seem to be aware of it or at least aren’t applying it. 

So we decided to start collecting together the research that seems most useful to job satisfaction, and explain how it applies to your career decisions.

##A summary of our findings so far


* “Do what you’re passionate about” may not be very useful, and [may actually be counterproductive.](http://80000hours.org/blog/62-don-t-do-what-you-re-passionate-about-part-2) We’re often [not that great at predicting](http://80000hours.org/blog/77-do-you-really-know-what-job-will-make-you-happy) how happy something will make us, or how long that happiness will last.
* Some simple methods might improve these predictions: [using a simple formula](http://80000hours.org/blog/117-a-formula-for-the-perfect-job), or looking at [what the average person](http://80000hours.org/blog/126-want-to-be-successful-know-your-odds) enjoys.
* Often [aiming for happiness too directly doesn’t work.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_hedonism)
* Better instead to aim for happiness indirectly: research suggests we should look for [mental challenge, the single best predictor of job satisfaction](http://80000hours.org/blog/68-how-to-find-a-job-you-ll-love) - though other factors, especially how well a career fits with the rest of your life, are also arguably very important.
* Finding a career you love and making a difference may conflict less than you think: [helping others makes us happy](http://80000hours.org/blog/75-should-we-sacrifice-doing-what-we-love-to-make-a-difference-part-1), plus happy people tend to be more productive and better at problem solving. So [you’ll make more difference in a career you enjoy](http://80000hours.org/blog/76-should-we-sacrifice-doing-what-we-love-to-make-a-difference-part-2).

<br>


##What should you do to find a job you love?


What you’ll really want to know, I’m sure, is how to actually go about finding a job you’ll love, given all these findings.

Here’s our current best guess at how to do this - and we’re hoping to be able to improve further on this soon with more work!

1) **Score each of your career options on a scale of 1 to 5, for each of the 5 predictors of job satisfaction** (independence, sense of completion, feedback, variety, and contribution - see the detailed summary of our research below for more information on this) 
You may also want to add a couple of other factors you think are particularly important to you, ideally based on [positive psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology) or past experiences. You might want to factor in something like location of work or working hours, for example, if you’ve evidence from past experience that these are likely to substantially affect your career happiness.

2) **Do this by getting a good grasp of what each option involves**: especially what it involves on a day-to-day basis, which can be all too easily overlooked. Speaking to people with experience in the area you’re considering is really important. The following questions might also help:

*How much does this job allow me to decide myself how and when I do my work?* (Independence)

*How much does the job involve doing a whole, identifiable piece of work with an obvious beginning and end?* (Sense of Completion)

*How much does this job require you to do many different things, using a variety of your skills and talents?* (Variety)

*How much are the results of your work likely to significantly affect the lives or well-being of other people?* (Contribution)

*How much does the job itself (aside from feedback from coworkers) provide you with information about how well you’re doing?* (Feedback)

3) **The career with the highest overall score is likely to be the one you’ll find most satisfying.** You don't necessarily have to weight all factors evenly: if you think contribution and feedback are roughly twice as important as the other factors, for example, you might multiply the scores for these by two in the overall score.

* * *

##Our research


Now for a more detailed overview of the research we’ve done around job satisfaction leading to these conclusions:

1) **Conventional wisdom isn’t all it’s cracked up to be**

[“Do what you’re passionate about”](http://80000hours.org/blog/62-don-t-do-what-you-re-passionate-about-part-1) is commonly quoted careers advice, but may not actually be that useful.

Passions aren’t things we’re born with. They tend to develop, through mastery and challenging and rewarding work.[^1] This means if you limit yourself to things you’re already passionate about, you might miss a bunch of career options you could really enjoy.

There are some other problems with the “do what you’re passionate about” approach to job satisfaction. What if you don’t know what you’re passionate about? What if you have multiple passions and you don’t know how to balance them or satisfy them all? What if your passions don’t translate easily into a job? And passions change. So choosing a job based on a fleeting current passion might not lead to job satisfaction in the long-term. 

This implies we need a more systematic method for finding a satisfying career than conventional advice would suggest.

2) **Aiming directly for happiness may not be the best idea.**

*“Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself.” Victor Frankl, Man’s Search for Meaning.*

What all the happiness research suggests is that happiness isn’t so much an end goal, but rather a byproduct of certain other activities. Doing things only because we think they’ll make us happy might end up backfiring, as often the pleasure comes from doing something for its own sake. There’s also evidence that extrinsic rewards for an activity (such as money) reduce [intrinsic motivation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivation) for that activity. You end up doing it because someone’s paying you, rather than because you want to.[^2] So focusing too much on your salary might actually prevent you from enjoying your job! (Plus it looks like the received wisdom [“money doesn’t make you happy”](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489.full) is pretty accurate - certainly past a certain point.)

Looking for what will make us happy in this direct sense might also lead us in the wrong direction. A [number of biases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_forecasting) mean that our judgements of how happy a career will make us, or how long that happiness will last [may well be flawed or inaccurate](http://80000hours.org/blog/77-do-you-really-know-what-job-will-make-you-happy). 

We’re not entirely sure yet what the best way for avoiding these biases is: [using a simple formula based on a “structured interview”-style process](http://80000hours.org/blog/117-a-formula-for-the-perfect-job) looks like it might help. This is what we’ve built into our suggested process above: scoring careers on a range of important factors and then combining these scores in a formula. By testing this process we’ll get a better idea of how helpful this is in practice. Paying attention to [base rates](http://80000hours.org/blog/126-want-to-be-successful-know-your-odds) also seems a promising tactic for avoiding some of these biases.

3) **Look for predictors of job satisfaction**

Rather than aiming for happiness directly, aim for those activities evidence suggests make us happy. Based on the research, the best predictor of job satisfaction seems to be mental challenge, which can be broken down into 5 characteristics:[^1]

* Independence

* Sense of completion

* Variety

* Contribution

* Feedback

A suggested method for finding a job you’ll enjoy then would be to score careers on each of these 5 predictors, and choose the option with the highest overall score.

One explanation for why these 5 predictors work is that these kind of activities allow us to enter a state known as [flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). This is what happens when you get so engaged in an activity that everything else disappears and time passes quickly. So it might also help to think about those times when you can remember feeling like this. What kinds of activities crop up a lot here? How could you [find a job that incorporates them](http://germaneconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/work-life-flow-wileypubs-72010.pdf)?

This obviously doesn’t cover it all: other factors, especially those concerning how well a career fits with the rest of your life, are arguably very important. We’re planning to explore this more in the future.

4) **Happiness and altruism**

Finding a job you’ll love is hard. Finding a job you’ll love that makes a difference: well that seems even harder. But these might conflict less than you think.

First, [helping others makes you happy](http://80000hours.org/blog/75-should-we-sacrifice-doing-what-we-love-to-make-a-difference-part-1). It has been linked to states of flow, and provides a sense of meaning and purpose to activities which helps to engage the “contribution” part of mental challenge mentioned above.

Second, [we’ll make more difference if we enjoy our jobs](http://80000hours.org/blog/76-should-we-sacrifice-doing-what-we-love-to-make-a-difference-part-2). Aside from the fact that happy people help others more, they are also just more productive, better at problem solving, so are more likely to be successful in whatever they do.

##How we’ve done our research


Our research so far has involved surveying the key psychology literature on happiness and job satisfaction in particular. To make sure our conclusions are reliable, we’ve looked for meta-analyses and summary papers/textbooks to support the results of studies wherever possible. Where findings talk about happiness and decision making in cases other than career choice, we were careful to evaluate how analogous the cases studied were to career choice to justify any inferences drawn. 

Some of the research we’ve looked at is directly relevant to career choice: the predictors of job satisfaction, for example. But we’ve also looked at more general research concerning decision making and speculated about how this might apply to career choice specifically. We looked at the biases that affect predictions of future happiness in general and considered how this might affect predictions of job satisfaction. We found research that suggested a simple formula might improve predictions in uncertain environments, and proposed that this might help with choosing a career too. What we haven’t done is test these results for career choice directly, which is important if we want to be confident in the relevance of this research. We’re planning to do this soon (see below.)

##Next steps

There’s still much more we can do to better understand job satisfaction, and provide more actionable advice on how to find a satisfying career. Our next moves will be to:

* Build a more detailed model to help people factor in considerations relevant to job satisfaction: this will include the components of mental challenge, as well as other evidence-based considerations such as income and working hours.
* Test this model directly in our advising sessions and potentially in academic research to find out if it helps people with their decisions.

Directions for longer-term research:

* Look into how to identify and measure the relevant considerations (e.g. those comprising mental challenge) in specific jobs, and how to maximise these factors within a job.
* Similarly, further research into which activities produce a state of flow, and how to experience flow more frequently.
* Developing a better understanding of the biases which affect our ability to predict how much we’ll enjoy different jobs, and debiasing techniques so we can improve on these predictions.

We can think of this, very roughly, as saving 90 lives. This doesn’t, however, show how much difference you make by *becoming* a doctor. Working this out requires a number of adjustments. The first is that we need to work out the impact of *additional* doctors, instead of the average doctor.

There’s already about 200,000 doctors in the UK. By becoming a doctor, let’s suppose I increase the number of doctors to 200,001. And let’s assume that all doctors in the UK are equally skilled (we’ll relax this assumption in the next post). The extra doctor won’t produce a benefit of 2600 QALYs. That’s because doctors perform a huge variety of tasks. Some of these do more for the UK’s health than others. The NHS (to some extent) prioritises its distribution of resources so that the most effective tasks get done first. This is part of the remit of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence. So, if there’s one extra doctor, the tasks they do will be less effective than those that are already being done. So we’d expect an *additional* doctor to have less impact than the 200,000 people who are already doctors. This is called *diminishing marginal returns.*

How can we take the figure for the average impact of a doctor and work out the impact of an additional doctor? One very rough way of estimating this is to look at the maximum the NHS is prepared to spend to save on QALY, and compare it to the average it spends. We know the maximum the NHS is willing to pay for a QALY is [between £20 000 to £30 000](http://www.nice.org.uk/niceMedia/pdf/GuidelinesManualChapter8.pdf). This suggests that *extra* money given to the NHS produces about 1 QALY per £25,000. Assuming that the NHS can freely spend between salaries and technologies and is fairly good at working out when it is more effective to spend money on either, then the marginal benefit of a doctor per year is their salary (£69 952) divided by the cut off (£25 000), making for **120 QALYs** over a career (1). However, this assumption is unlikely to be true. So let’s try some better approaches:

###Approach 1: Life expectancy versus number of doctors.

Plotting the most recent values the world bank has ([Source](http://data.worldbank.org/)), we get the following plot:

<center><a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/19/original/Life_expectancy_versus_doctors_per_1000_people.jpg?1346401142'><img alt="Life_expectancy_versus_doctors_per_1000_people" class="image medium" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/19/medium/Life_expectancy_versus_doctors_per_1000_people.jpg?1346401142" /></a></center>

We see an ‘r’ shaped sort of trend: the life expectancy initially goes up briskly with an increase in doctors per capita, but this relationship levels off as the doctors per capita increases beyond 1 per thousand or so. So it looks like there are diminishing returns of adding more doctors. A similar picture emerges when other sorts of ‘investment’ in health are considered: see for example the plots of [health spending per capita versus life expectancy](http://ucatlas.ucsc.edu/spend.php), or [GDP per capita versus life expectancy](http://www.oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/wp-content/uploads/life-expectancy-v-gdp.png).

From here, we can begin to work out the marginal impact of adding ‘one more doctor’ to the UK: one adds a best-fit line to the data, and see what how much ‘gain’ there is in health when you move ‘one more doctor’ along that line from where the UK is now. This gives a final answer of **950 QALYs** per medical career, just over a third of our original estimate for the impact of a doctor. (I’ve included the working out in a footnote for the interested (2).)

This method of estimation isn’t perfect. It looks at *all countries*, whilst we might want to use data only from developed countries to look at the impact of doctors in the UK. Much like our previous post, wealth remains a potential confounder: both life expectancy and doctors per capita correlate with gross domestic product, and it might just be that richer societies are able to buy better education, hygiene, nutrition, and other things that *really* do the work of making their inhabitants healthier, and they coincidentally buy more doctors too.

###Approach 2: OECD health data and regression

We can try a different tack to try and accommodate these concerns. The [OECD](http://www.oecd.org/) is a group of wealthy to fairly wealthy countries which maintain records of themselves along a variety of indicators. Amongst these are life expectancy, healthcare spending per capita,  doctors per 1000 people, and gross national income per capita adjusted for purchasing power parity. We can regress these to a combined model to work out how large a contribution each of these factors make to improved life expectancy, and, once again, we can then work out how big an effect changing one of our variables (doctors per capita) by ‘one more doctor’ will change the life expectancy of the population. The final answer here is that the impact of one more doctor is around **670 QALYs**. (Again, the full working in a footnote (3).)


###Approach 3: WHO disability adjusted life years

A lot of comments in the [previous post](http://80000hours.org/blog/72-how-many-lives-does-a-doctor-save) were worried about *quality* of life, and not just length. Although I tried to account for this by Bunker’s estimates of how much good medicine does via removing disability, it would be nice to tackle the issue more explicitly.

The WHO keeps data on the [burden of disability](http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_country/en/index.html) in a population, as DALYs per 100 000 people (a DALY is a measure of length and quality of life, it is the *inverse* of a QALY - *more* DALYs are a *bad* thing, as well as other differences summarized [here](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.23.100901.140513)). Plotting DALYs per 100 000 against doctors per 100 000 gives the following:

<center><a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/18/original/Dalysper100000versusdoctorsper100000.jpg?1346401141'><img alt="Dalysper100000versusdoctorsper100000" class="image medium" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/18/medium/Dalysper100000versusdoctorsper100000.jpg?1346401141" /></a> </center>

This graph looks like a mirror image of the life expectancy versus doctors per capita graph above. Although we cannot directly compare ‘DALYs averted’ to ‘QALYs gained’, using a similar technique to approach 1 (draw a line of best fit, work out how much gain one makes by moving ‘one more doctor’ along, and multiply appropriately) means each doctor averts **645 DALYs** per career. This reassures us our figures are on the right track.

###Conclusion###
These estimates are necessarily very rough, though it’s reassuring to find our three estimates in the same ball park. Splitting the difference between our three best estimates gives the impact of ‘one more’ medical career in the UK as about **760** QALYs, around a third of our estimate of the average doctor. Looking at the degree of noise in the data, I estimate the 95% confidence interval is about 600 - 920 QALYs.

The expected impact of becoming a doctor is now around 25 lives: still pretty good, but giving 10% to effective charities can produce a health benefit *25 times* larger than that. This underlines the importance of thinking at the margin for those wanting to make the biggest difference they can. One should try to estimate not how much good a career does in general, but how much *more* good they can do if you get involved. In the case of first world medicine, it appears most of the highest priority interventions for improving health and wellbeing have already been done, and so the additional impact of one more doctor is not that large.

Our estimate, however, is still too generous. By becoming a doctor I *won’t* increase the number of doctors by one. Rather, it seems I’ll just take the job from someone else. I’ll be *replaceable.* We’ll look at this adjustment in the last post.

(1) Full working: £69 952/year * 43 years / £25 000/QALY = 120 QALYs 

(2) First, we need to find the best fit relationship between number of doctors and life expectancy. The best candidate for this is a hyperbolic curve: it seems plausible there will be a ceiling on how far life expectancy could rise through adding more doctors, even in the limit case of a population comprised entirely of doctors treating each other.

This graph is the same as the first, save we have shifted down 47 units - the amount we [estimated earlier](http://80000hours.org/blog/72-how-many-lives-does-a-doctor-save) would be the baseline of no medicine, and so the values on the Y-axis are ‘added years’ of life expectancy. The hyperbola is given by the dashed blue line. Now we have our trend, we can work out the expected impact of moving the UK from its current doctors per capita (2.743 per 1000) to the value it would have with one extra doctor.(1)

The equation of our best fit line is given by:

    Added life expectancy = 30.79459*(Doctors per capita)/(0.16801+Doctors per capita) 

So plugging in the difference between our current doctors per capita and the ‘one more doctor’ case:

    Marginal change = 30.79459*(2.743016)/(0.16801+2.73016) - 30.79459*(2.743016)/(0.16801+2.743016) = 9.76877 * 10^-6 years.  

So the marginal impact of one more doctor in the UK will raise UK life expectancy by just under one ten-thousandth of a year. Putting this change into added years of healthy life requires us to multiply by the population of the UK, as well as a correction factor due to our [prior estimate] that for every 9 years of lifespan medicine adds, it adds another 5 years of healthy life via freedom from disability.

    Marginal QALY yield per doctor = 9.76877 * 10^-6 * 62,641,000 * 14/9 = 950 (2sf)

(3) We can regress these data to a linear model, such that:

    Life expectancy = k1 + k2*(GNIPPP) + k3*(Doctors per 1000) +k4*(Healthcare spending pc)

Where k1, k2, k3, and k4 are constants. The best fitting model (adjusted R-square 0.32, P=0.002)

    Life expectancy = 75.336 + 0.0000291*(GDIPPP) + 0.433*(doc/1000) + 0.000886*(healthcare spending pc)

This model explains about a third of the variance (adjusted R-square = 0.32), suggesting the main determinants of health in wealthier countries are *not* wealth, nor spending on healthcare, nor number of doctors. However, of these three it is health spending that is the largest factor, and the effects of either GNIPPP or doctors per 1000 population are negligible - neither are statistically significant, and 95% confidence intervals for either variable cross zero. In other words, we cannot be that confident, on the basis of this analysis, that increasing the number of doctors per capita increases life expectancy *at all*.

Our best estimate of changing doctors per capita given by the 0.433 coefficient - our central measure. From this we can work out the marginal impact ‘one extra doctor has’ by the similar procedure to before:

    0.433*0.0000160 extra doctors per capita = 6.91*10^-6 years in added life expectancy
    6.91*10^-6 * 62 641 000 * 14/9 = 673 QALYs ]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>Q</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2012-09-16 23:24:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>650</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Carl Shulman</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>carl.shulman@post.harvard.edu</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/carl-shulman</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-10-22 20:10:29</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[" Looking at the degree of noise in the data, I estimate the 95% confidence interval is about 600 - 920 QALYs."

It’s not just that people think earning lots of money is bad, it’s also that a lot of the careers that make you really rich involve things that also seem immoral.

The example of our times is investment banking. It’s hard to be precise about why investment banking is bad, and I’m pretty sure that most people who think bankers do harm don’t really have much of an idea of what bankers do.  But it seems plausible that irresponsible risk-taking in some parts of the banking system has had a really negative effect on millions of lives.

Let’s suppose, for sake of argument, that banking is pretty bad. That raises the question: is it bad to become a banker? Banking isn’t just a relevant example because it’s topical. It’s also one of the highest earning salaried careers available today. If I’m picking a career with the intention of giving away a large portion of what I earn, can I pick a job that causes harm because I think the money I give away will do more good?

One interesting thing you can do is to work out the total harm of the investment banking industry and compare it against the good you can do with your donations directly.
But that’s only a small part of the issue. This article will look at something called the replaceability effect. It’s the idea that, often, if you don’t take a job, someone else will take it. For some types of jobs, this is a very safe assumption, and it makes the harm you do by taking a job in an unethical industry much smaller than you might first guess.

The second article in this series will address a potential problem of this line of reasoning: [collective action](http://80000hours.org/blog/61-collective-action-working-in-unethical-industries-part-2). If everyone acts assuming that someone else will do the dirty work if they don’t, you get collective action problems where everyone would be happier if they could all agree not to do the job. That article involves a bit of game theory. The [third article](http://80000hours.org/blog/64-universalisability-immoral-industries-part-3) in the series asks whether we should be making these sorts of arguments at all. Perhaps there are some things you just shouldn’t be party to, no matter what you could bring about if you were.

Suppose I want to be an investment banker. I’ll be earning stupid amounts of money pretty quickly, so let’s say I’m happy to donate 50% of what I earn to the most effective causes. I’ll still be making more than the median household income, in my early 20s. But I’m worried about the harm I’m doing.

The first thing to remember is that what’s most important is [not what I do directly, but is what my choices bring about](/blog/18-just-what-is-making-a-difference-counterfactuals-and-career-choice). In Ben’s excellent article, he points out that you’d be crazy if you wanted to push paramedics out of the way to treat your injured parents. In that case, it’s pretty clear that we don’t actually think you should care about what you do yourself, but rather about the difference between what happens after your choice and what would have happened otherwise.

Now, if I decide not to become a banker, what difference does that make? Someone else gets the job. Top investment banking jobs are heavily sought after; there’ll be plenty of people willing to take your place. So what are the differences between me and them?

*I care about the ethics of my choices.* If we start with the assumption that lots of bankers aren’t particularly ethically motivated, it seems extremely likely that I care more about ethics than the person who would replace me. That means that if a choice ever comes up which I am fairly free to decide on, I’m more likely to make the ethical choice. (If there are no choices where I’m free to decide one, then my being the banker doesn’t do any harm anyhow.)

*I’m giving half away.* If one of the harms of banking is that it perpetuates wealth inequality, then this is just good on its own. But probably more importantly, the charities I donate to will be able to save literally tens of thousands of lives over the course of my career. The person who replaces me would probably donate fairly little to charities. The top 20% of spenders, a bracket almost all bankers would fall into, donate on average about [0.4% of their spending](http://www.cgap.org.uk/uploads/Briefing%20Papers/CGAP%20BN7%20How%20generous%20is%20the%20UK.pdf). That’s a lot less than 50% of income – especially since, if you save, that ends up at more than half of spending. They’re also probably not particularly interested in finding out which charities are the best charities. That matters a lot, because there are huge differences in the cost-effectiveness of charities. It’s hard to say how huge, but a _very_ conservative estimate makes the difference between the best charities and the median charities at least a factor of 100, and it could be many times more than that.

*I’m better at it.* This is a slightly dodgy assumption. The selection process is competitive enough at the top end that the choice between top candidates is probably pretty random. It’s also not clear if this is a good or a bad thing. We might think that, even though banking is harmful now, it couId be good if only it changed a few things – like risk-taking incentives. If we think that, then having more skilled bankers might be better. Otherwise, we might prefer to starve the industry of skilled people. But in either case, because the differences in ability are so slight, it’s pretty marginal.

On top of that, there’s a long term point to be made. If good people stay out of banking because it’s harmful, banking isn’t going to go away, but it’s not likely to get better any time soon. Getting people who care about ethics into the industry might be the only way to make the industry ethical.

There’s a bunch of additional points that we might want to bring out. One is that I also need to think about what I would do if I didn’t take the job. If there’s another job that does about as much good and no harm at all, then I should take that one. But that’s pretty obvious.

Another nuance is that we have to think about the chain of events the other guy starts off when he moves into a different job. He pushes someone else out of a job and the whole thing spirals down the chain. But, of course, if I were to take a different job I’d be denying someone else a job.  So, it’s a bit more complicated than I’ve made out. But because banking is so competitive all of the effects here are pretty small.

One concern a lot of people have is this: when I take a banking job I’m sending a signal to people around me that I think the banking industry is good. Now, I think it’s hard to be persuaded by that. First, although I’m sure we all have very high opinions of ourselves, realistically no-one else will be particularly moved by your job choice. You’d have to be a particularly messianic figure for your signal to have that kind of effect. Second, you don’t need to be a silent victim to the first impressions other people have from your job choice. If your job choice sends a signal, so be it. You can send other signals too - like joining 80,000 Hours and telling your friends about why you did it.

The basic replaceability argument is only a rough sketch of the whole picture. It shows us that when we look at the consequences of our actions, and inspect the simple choice of whether or not to take a job in a harmful industry, the harm of our taking the job is somewhat less than it first appears. Obviously, though, there is still a harm. So you shouldn’t take the job unless you think you can do something pretty good with it. The argument, so far, has also only looked at the effects of the actual choice. It hasn’t looked at the effects of the sorts of attitudes involved in thinking about the choice this way. That’s what the next article is about. It also hasn’t answered the basic question, which we’ll examine in the third article, about whether weighing up consequences like this is the right way to go about it at all.

Often when faced with a really difficult question, people “cheat” by opting to answer an easier but related one, without realising they’re doing it. For example, if someone asks you “How happy are you with your life right now?” you might find you actually end up giving the answer to an easier (but related) question such as “How happy do I feel at the moment?” or “How happy am I with my love life right now?”[^1] Sometimes this is a helpful tactic, but it can be a huge source of error. Could you be doing this with your career decisions? Is it helping you, or holding you back?

##Answering an easier question

This tactic of “answering an easier question” is formally known as the [attribute substitution heuristic.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_substitution) It was proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Shane Frederick in 2002 as underpinning a number of the mental shortcuts we use, that can lead to biases.[^2] Studies have shown that this tactic of “answering an easier question” is used by people when answering difficult questions in a variety of different situations: including [how likely a person is to do a certain job](http://80000hours.org/blog/126-want-to-be-successful-know-your-odds#fn:3),[^3] which of two cities is larger,[^4]  and what volume of a cube a sphere will occupy if dropped into it[^5]. 

##Common cheats in career choice.

What are some common “cheat” questions people use in their career decisions?

1) **Which careers are most popular?**

It’s easy to just follow the crowd when you’re not sure what to do. Often when a lot of people are doing something, it’s because it’s the right thing to do. Robert Cialdini talks about our tendency to do this in his book *Influence* (which I’d highly recommend), a phenomenon also known as [social proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof).[^6] The problem with social proof is it can lead us astray if we follow it too blindly: other people don’t always know best.

There are several reasons why following everyone else might not be a good idea in career decisions. First, other people are likely as uncertain about their career decisions as we are: so are probably following others too! Second, others might have reasons for choosing a career that don’t apply to you: so blindly copying their decisions without considering these reasons might lead you down the wrong path. Say you take a career in investment banking because you notice it’s where a large proportion of graduates seem to be going. If the reason the crowd is going into finance is because the jobs are highly paid, this won’t work for you if salary isn’t high on your list of priorities. Third, if you follow the crowd, you’ll miss under-resourced opportunities, which can often be much higher impact. Popular options are likely to be ones where your “direct” impact is clear, but as mentioned previously, in these cases [your *true* impact is often much less](http://80000hours.org/blog/113-find-the-gate).

 **Ask yourself why certain careers are incredibly popular, and question whether these reasons are good ones or really apply to you. Rather than just following the crowd, try to consider under-resourced options that the crowd might be missing.**

2) **Which careers come most easily to mind?**

There’s a tendency to assume that because something is familiar or comes easily to mind, it must be good: a shortcut known as the [availability heuristic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic). This means when trying to choose between a number of options, we’re likely to substitute the easier question “Which ones have I heard of?” for “Which one is the best?” Popular jobs are likely to be familiar, but there are other reasons a certain job might come to mind easily: a certain profession might have a strong family history, or a specific industry might be particularly big near where you live, for example. These factors don’t necessarily mean a career or industry is right for you. 

**If you find yourself being biased towards more familiar careers, look more closely: what makes them familiar? Question whether these are good reasons for you to choose that particular path.** Even if they are, it’s still a good idea to seek out and consider less familiar possibilities (by speaking to lots of different people, for example) to broaden your options.

3) **Which career stereotypes do I fit best?**

Another common mistake is to judge which careers will suit you best based on how well you believe you fit certain career “stereotypes.” There are several ways in which this can obviously go wrong. First, stereotypes can be highly inaccurate, and don’t apply to everyone: accounting might be a stereotypically “boring” job, but some people love it. **Without finding out more about what a job really involves on a day-to-day basis, it’s very hard to know if you’ll enjoy or excel in it.** 

Second, even if you understand what a career involves, you might still have a mistaken view of whether it will be right for you. Just as it’s important not to stereotype careers too quickly without getting more information, it’s also important not to do the same for yourself! Working out what you enjoy and are good at is hard, but it’s worth taking some time to understand better. Getting more experience and feedback from other people are two good ways to start doing this, and we’re hoping to have more advice on this in the future.

##Cheating “making a difference”

As well as in career choice in general, answering an easier question seems like something people often do when they think about making a difference. “How do I make a difference with my career?” is clearly a very complex question: if it wasn’t, 80,000 Hours wouldn’t have much to do! There are a lot of different things to consider: who you’re helping directly, what you might be doing indirectly, who’d be doing what you’re doing if you weren’t, what else you could be doing... and so on. And like with career choice in general, it’s really hard to predict how different paths will work out.

One question people seem to commonly “cheat” with when thinking about making a difference is “Which careers are commonly viewed as being ‘ethical’?” **But those careers that most people think of as ethical aren’t necessarily the ones that help people the most: some might [not actually help people](http://80000hours.org/blog/66-social-interventions-gone-wrong) [at all](http://80000hours.org/blog/93-why-most-charity-fundraisers-cause-harm).** Even if a conventionally ethical career *does* do good, the fact it’s well-known means it’s unlikely to be under-resourced, so your true contribution won’t be as much as it seems.

##When is it worth cheating?

If substituting an easier question is such a common source of error, why do we do it? Sometimes cheat questions work pretty well. If we need an answer quickly and don’t have time to get more information, answering an easier but related question might be the best we can do. If I asked you to name the largest US cities in a minute, answering an easier question: “Which US cities come to mind most easily?” is probably the best you can do. It might also actually turn out to be pretty accurate: as the cities that come to mind easily will be the most well-known, and larger cities tend to be better known. If I gave you more time, though, you’d go out and get more information about the size of US cities.

On the other hand, if I asked you whether there were more words in the English language beginning with the letter r, or with the letter r in the middle of the word, the same tactic doesn’t work so well. It’s much easier to call to mind words beginning with the letter r, but there are actually more words in English with the letter r in the middle. The *reason* certain words are more readily called to mind is not that they are more frequent: rather it’s because of the way we organise our dictionaries, by first letter. The fact that something is easy to think of doesn’t always mean it’s more common: so the question “Which types of x can I think of most easily?” isn’t always a good substitute for “Which types of x are most frequent?”

On the whole, cheating by answering an easier question is helpful when:

* The question you’re trying to answer is very complex
* There’s a much easier to answer question which is closely related: what determines the answer to the substitute question is the same as what determines the answer you’re trying to find, at least most of the time
* Time is limited or you’re unable to get more information in some other way

The first clearly applies to career choice and explains why we may often try to “cheat” on this. The second and third conditions, though, arguably don’t hold for career choice, which explains why cheating rarely helps career decisions. What makes for the perfect career is determined by a large number of different factors, and most of the “cheat” or substitute questions we use will leave out some important ones. Although you may feel pressured to make career decisions quickly, it’s really worth spending a great deal of time on: it’s 80,000 hours of your life, after all! Plus there’s an abundance of information out there to help you if you know where to look.

##What can you do about this?

Given it looks like “answering an easier question” isn’t a good tactic in career choice, how can you avoid it, and what should you do instead? I’ve talked about some examples of common ways in which people cheat career choice by asking an easier question, and how to steer clear of these, but this certainly isn’t exhaustive. How can you avoid cheating career choice in general?

1) **First, try to identify which easier questions you might be substituting for “Which career is right for me?”** Our suggestions may help, but there are certainly others. Discussing your career decisions with others and asking for their feedback might help you to do this.

2) Once you’ve identified your “cheat” questions, ask yourself whether they’re really good enough. **Would an answer to the substituted question necessarily give you the same answer to the question you’re really after?**

3) **If not, what information do you need to answer your question that answering the “cheat” question doesn’t give you? **

This is also a good way for identifying what extra information you need in order to make better career decisions. 

In general, rather than substituting an easier question, have a more systematic method for answering the *real* question. **Answering a highly related but easier question is a good tactic when time is limited or you can’t get more information.** But neither of these things apply in career choice: it’s a decision worth spending a large amount of time on, and you can pretty much always get more information. We’re currently working on a process to help you with this: if you’d like to help us by testing it, please get in touch!

People often end up cheating and answering an easier question because the real question is so complex that they don’t even know how to go about answering it. Often, though, it’s worth trying a bit harder to answer the real question, even if it seems daunting. What we’re aiming to do is provide you with the tools and guidance you need to answer the questions “Which career is right for me?” and “How can I make a difference in my career?”, so that you don’t need to cheat.

I think the attribute substitution heuristic occurs in charity evaluation, too. Percentage administration costs, or the salary of the highest-pad employee of a charity, are very easy to measure and compare across charities. Actual impact, in contrast, is very difficult. So most charity evaluators focus on the former rather than the latter.

I was surprised, though, that you didn't mention a couple of very common heuristics for career choice: "What am I passionate about?" and "What am I best at?". In my view, these are the equivalents of percentage administration costs and employee's salaries - when I think about my own career choice, I find myself thinking in terms of these two heuristics. They are much more tractable than actual impact, and by using them I can console myself by thinking that, all other things being equal, I should do what I'm passionate about or what I'm good at. Unfortunately for an easy decision, all other things are almost never equal - some careers by their nature vary dramatically in their impact.

So, far from being useful, these two heuristics can end up distracting one from the real issue - namely, impact. Just like percentage administration costs!]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Estimation is the best we have</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/4-estimation-is-the-best-we-have</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[This argument seems common to many debates:

> Proposal P arrogantly assumes that it is possible to measure X, when really
> X is hard to measure and perhaps even changes depending on other factors.
> Therefore we shouldn’t do P

This could make sense if X wasn’t especially integral to the goal. For
instance if the proposal were to measure short distances by triangulation
with nearby objects, a reasonable criticism would be that the angles are hard
to measure, relative to measuring the distance directly. But this argument is
commonly used in situations where optimizing X is the whole point of the
activity, or a large part of it.

Criticism of cost-benefit approaches to doing good provides a prime example.
A common argument is that it’s just not possible to tell if you are
increasing net welfare, or by how much. The critic concludes then that a
different strategy is better, for instance some sort of intuitive adherence
to strict behavioural rules.

But if what we fundamentally think matters most is increasing welfare, or at
least reducing extreme suffering, then the extreme difficulty of doing the
associated mathematics perfectly should not warrant abandoning the goal. One
should always be better off putting the reduced effort one is willing to
contribute into what accuracy it buys, rather than throwing it away on a
strategy that is more random with regard to one’s goal.

A CEO would sound ridiculous making this argument to his shareholders: ‘You
guys are being ridiculous. It’s just not possible to know which actions will
increase the value of the company exactly how much. Why don’t we try to make
sure that all of our meetings end on time instead?’

In general, when optimizing X somehow is integral to the goal, the argument
must fail. If the point is to make X as close to three as possible for
instance, no matter how bad your best estimate is of what X will be under
different conditions, you can’t do better by ignoring X altogether. If you
had a non-estimating-X strategy which you anticipated would do better than
your best estimate in getting a good value of X, then you in fact believe
yourself to have a better estimating-X strategy.

Probabilistic risk assessment is claimed by some to be impossibly difficult.
People are often wrong, and may fail to think of certain contingencies in
advance. So if we want to know how prepared to be for a nuclear war for
instance, we should do something qualitative with scenarios and the like.
This could be a defensible position. Perhaps intuitions can better implicitly
assess probabilities via some other activity than explicitly thinking about
them.  However I have not heard this claim accompanied by any motivating
evidence. And if it were true, it would likely make sense to convert the
qualitative assessments into quantitative ones and aggregate them with
information from other sources, rather than disregarding quantitative
assessments all together.

I totally agree that doing some impact estimation is critical, but I also think that it's important that we are aware of its limits, and take it with a grain of salt.

There's a fantastic, rigorous critique of relying solely on "Expected Value" estimates of impact of charitable donations here, and I think the argument cross-applies for career planning:

In addition, I know that I personally fall a little subject to "analysis paralysis" on this kind of issue, and often do underestimate the power of "unknown unknowns" (as mentioned by Stewart) or other shortcomings in my analysis.  I suspect that others reading this blog might be of a similar disposition and could be prone to similar mistakes.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>351</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Benjamin Todd</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>benjamin.john.todd@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/benjamin-todd</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-05-18 22:08:15</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[But what strategy should you use instead?

In 80k strategy, we often consider applying some weight to common-sense, since in some cases it might actually be optimised, or reflect some of things you miss if you're too analytic.

That's an interesting example to think about. Why does scenario planning feel more useful than estimating the probabilities of various scenarios happening?

Well, the information we have is immensely biased and noisy, so the probabilities just aren't very good. Secondly, and very importantly, the return on investment on getting better estimates is pretty low; "the risks are non-negligeable so we should do something about them because nuclear war is so horrid" is already enough to justify a lot of action; fine tuning the estimates seems to give little extra return. Thirdly, we might get too obsessed with the details of the numbers, and forget the uncertainty (even if we don't have that failing, our institutions might). Related to this is worry about "unknown unknowns": we have reason to suspect, based on based experience, that events in a nuclear war will turn out to be unpredictable in ways we can't expect now. So we should build up general resilience, rather than refining probability estimates over an incomplete set of possible outcomes.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>359</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Jim Savage</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>javage@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-05-26 06:37:02</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It's a good point, Katja. 

Another approach quite popular in cost-benefit work is to suppose something like this: 

Say you have a policy goal regarding the outcome of a highly complex system, about which you know something but nowhere near everything. First, you must determine is some defined loss value associated with the goal (like a statistical life value, etc.). Normally, you would model both the losses in your simplified model of the base case and policy case and compare the discounted differences. But this opens itself up to the sorts of criticism you spell out. 

Instead of comparing one hypothetical projection of the expected loss against another (which includes the expected changes due to the policy), another approach is to look at the tuples of potential changes due to the policy and the probabilities of loss *for the point at which spending breaks even*. People seem better equipped to see whether these are plausible values than they are at determining potential outcomes of very complicated systems.

The Bayesian approach involves both, quantitative, objective data and qualitative, subjective expert knowledge – this approach of modelling uncertainty is often termed expert system and was particular popular in the 1980s.

It can be quite powerful: Combining quantitative medical data with subjective expert knowledge for example lead to a model that could predict a disease from symptoms better than experienced medical doctors (@Benjamin: such models would also allow to integrate new information quite easily). However, as you already mentioned in your post, such models are quite difficult and expensive to construct.

Models that use newer algorithms are much easier to construct and yield even better, more accurate predictions – however they need large amounts of quantitative data and cannot deal with semantic data yet. But I am quite sure that this is how these problems will be addressed and solved in the near future.

I agree that trade-offs must come into it and in this sense all quantitative and qualitative information are effectively evaluated on a single metric (given that only one choice or decision can be made at once). 
As a perhaps slightly off topic aside, I have been studying cost-benefit analysis recently and came across the work of Jack Dowie who you may be interested in as he provides an (for me) illuminating framework for conceptualising how real world decisions are made with reference to different categories of belief (evidence) and preferences (values) ranging on a scale of intuition to analysis ratios. His paper is still being finalised but you should be able to find a presentation on his conceptual map called JUDEMAKIA via Google.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>228</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Niel Bowerman</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>niel.bowerman@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/niel-bowerman</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-03-21 12:14:10</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[An assumption behind this entire post is that X somehow fits into some linear quantitative scale.  The problem is that most people's conception of value or good doesn't do this.  The examples you use all have concrete linear quantitative outcomes (distance, stock price, etc.).

To help with this problem, a variety of personality tests have been developed. It’s hoped these tests provide understanding of your personality in a way that can be used to predict what sorts of job might suit.

One of the most widely used tests is the Myers-Briggs type indicator (MBTI). According to Malcolm Gladwell, 2.5 million Americans every year take the test and 89 out of the fortune 100 companies use it.(1)

But it turns out there are plenty of reasons to be sceptical about its use in choosing careers.

###Does the MBTI actually give you a meaningful type?###
The MBTI is normally used as a typology. It uses four measures of personality and for each measure people are classified into one of two types. The results of these are then combined to summarise the overall personality type. Since there are four measures, there are 16 possible overall personality types. The assumption that we can be classified into types like this turns out to be false.

**The distribution is not bimodal**
If this approach was right, we'd expect the distribution of scores on the Myers-Briggs measures to be bimodal – most people should be in either one or the other. The distribution is not like this - most people score between the two extremes(3). For example, most extraverts and introverts are fairly close together on the Extravert-Introvert scale with only a few people at either extreme. Because of this, the strict dichotomy leads to a false view of people's personalities.

**The types are not stable over time**
If the MBTI is to be used when choosing a career, it must detect stable personality types and not change much over time. So if someone is given the MBTI one day and then given it again a few weeks, months, or years later their classification shouldn't change much. But given that most people's scores lie in the centre of each measure, it doesn't take much change in the answers to some of the questions to lead to that person being reclassified as a different type. When people have been given the test on two occasions, the degree to which people's typology stays the same is lower than you would expect if it detected stable personality types(4).

**The responses don’t cluster**
If the Myers-Briggs refers to genuine personality types, we should be able to analyse responses to the questions and find that certain answers cluster together in ways that reflect the personality types. We should be able to find underlying factors in the data that are similar to the Myers-Briggs types. However, when factor analysis has been done on responses to the Myers Briggs questionnaire, the factors found did not correspond closely with the dichotomous Myers-Briggs measures(3). 

###Does it predict job performance?###
When thinking about career choice, it is important to have a personality test that predicts both job choice and work success. Whereas there is strong evidence that the consensus personality test in psychology (the big five personality test) predicts job performance(3,5) there is no such consensus about the MBTI.

###Origins in pseudo-science and possible reasons for popularity###
The MBTI was developed on the basis of work by the psychoanalyst Carl Jung. Since both Jung's theories and a typological approach to personality are no longer accepted by mainstream psychology there is little reason to expect that the MBTI is a fruitful approach to understanding personality. Indeed, despite it's unscientific nature, the theory behind the MBTI may be one of the reason's for it's popularity. Unlike more descriptive personality tests, the MBTI is linked to a theory of psychology that can be used in the interpretation of the questionnaire – this means that people can delve further into the theory to interpret their test results. The test is made even more satisfying because the “[T]he descriptions of each type are generally flattering and sufficiently vague so that most people will accept the statements as true of themselves.”(2) This contrasts with mainstream psychology's big 5 personality test, which can show someone in a specific negative light by giving them a high score on neuroticism and a low score on conscientiousness.

###Conclusion###
A national academy of sciences committee concluded in 1992 that “at this time, there is not sufficient, well-designed research to justify the use of the MBTI in career counselling programs”(6) and the evidence is little better now. 

The continued used of the MBTI is even more mysterious given the existence of the Big 5 personality test. As we’ll show in the next post, the Big 5 is the consensus personality test in psychology, as has been shown to have predictive power in a wide variety of domains, including job performance.

MBTI has helped me understand my own preferences and those of others I work with, and it has been invaluable to me in my career. It's a useful shorthand. 

Struggling to influence or communicate with someone? Probably has different preferences to you. Wonder why your boss's late night chats at your desk energise him, but leave you cream-crackered? Probably an E-I thing. Wondering whether to take a job? If you're different on every letter than you'll either spark off each other forever or wind up wanting to kill each other. Good to know. 

I've used it in all the teams I have headed up and each time it has helped people understand one another better. To my mind, that's a great thing. 

I also like that it doesn't celebrate one type over another, or one end of the scale over another. 

I don't doubt that it's not great for career guidance, I've known many fellow INFJs (we tend to gravitate together wherever I work, funnily enough) and we do not all enjoy the same roles. That's as much about values, past experiences and education as about type, I think. But that's not to say that MBTI doesn't have an awful lot of value. Otherwise, people would have saved their money and binned the test years ago. I'm a fan.

And some use the phrase ['ethical careers'](http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Ethical_Careers_Guide.html?id=Ugy0AAAACAAJ) as a near-synonym for [charity work](http://www.graduationpledge.org/newsite/wp-content/uploads/GPA_career_greater_good_proof_brochure.pdf). Of course, some charity workers do a lot of good. But there seem to be many [career](http://player.vimeo.com/video/32787159) [options](http://80000hours.org/high-impact-careers) that do at least as much good as charity workers. Why, then, do people [love charity workers](http://www.whydev.org/52-reasons-why-you-should-date-an-aid-worker/)? 

In this post, I discuss one possible explanation for the conventional wisdom about ethical careers: I suspect that many people implicitly view the extent of self-sacrifice required by our choices as a proxy for the moral value of our choices. Some of my altruistically minded friends are initially puzzled by the idea that (say) [secretarial work](http://80000hours.org/blog/54-the-high-impact-pa-how-anyone-can-bring-about-ground-breaking-research) can be more choice-worthy than charity work because the former can help important people do vastly more good. 

While they don't make this idea explicit, I think their tendency is to assume that jobs demanding greater self-sacrifice must be morally better. People may be disposed to hold this kind of view, in part, because our positive reactions to friend-favoring altruism [might not be sensitive to effectiveness](http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/124/4/1815.full.pdf), and because doing the right thing often involves sacrificing one's own interests. But morality and self-sacrifice do not always coincide. 

In the context of career choice, morality and self-sacrifice come apart. Aid workers have an extremely demanding job, with [low](http://www.amazon.com/Uncharitable-Restraints-Nonprofits-Contemporary-Perspectives/dp/1584659556) salaries, [cruel realities](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CFMQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmorealtitude.wordpress.com%2F2011%2F07%2F05%2F5-part-series-becoming-an-aid-worker%2F&ei=8-r-T4XVKcn00gHYn4nyBg&usg=AFQjCNGN5VapEAD4Eg5H3clPgc1NvvNaTw&sig2=_WiJheBzKZWjOsd5-eAfVw), and (in extreme cases) [high rates of mental problems](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CEwQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fihacs.org%2Ffiles%2FPapers%2FPsychological%2520problems%2520encounter%2520aid%2520workers%2520in%2520Darfur.pdf&ei=Oev-T8z3EsXZ0QHW18z6Bg&usg=AFQjCNGmX4-eyPbsiVUcAUuxGHxyRJ1-FQ&sig2=nU2JGaSCFhSd3Wd164Ircw). But many individual aid workers typically don't make much of a difference, since their jobs are often [replaceable](http://80000hours.org/blog/18-just-what-is-making-a-difference-counterfactuals-and-career-choice). If it’s morally important to make a difference, then self-sacrifice here is a poor guide to moral choice.  

Morality and self-sacrifice may come apart in other contexts as well. Donating 10 percent of your income to one of the most cost-effective charities may do [more good](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/resources/recommended-charities.php) than donating all of your money to one of the least cost-effective charities. Although the latter option is more self-sacrificial, it may be morally bankrupt.(1) And, to use an uncontroversial example, you needn't throw yourself onto a grenade if no one else is near enough to be in danger. 

Self-sacrifice is not sufficient for morality, because some selfless acts don't do enough good. And it's not always necessary, since the right thing to do is sometimes [in our interest](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7305395.stm). While self-sacrifice is importantly related to altruism, the correlation is clearly imperfect. People who enjoy finance and find the business world fascinating should be glad to learn that they can make the world a much better place as a professional philanthropist, without giving up their self-interested motivation.

I think that conflating morality with self-sacrifice may explain, in part, why some altruistically minded people are initially puzzled by the idea that becoming a banker could be morally better than becoming an aid worker. In a forthcoming post, I will offer one possible explanation behind the intuition that self-sacrifice is morally important.

It’s certainly the case that it’s too simple just to look at the difference between you and the person who replaces you. In general, there’s an ‘iteration effect’ where a whole chain of people switch jobs. The difference you make to some field is probably closer to the difference you make directly and the difference made by the worst person in the field. There are also effects from sliding the higher ability people into other jobs. It’s too simple to say that replaceability means aid workers don’t make a difference. Though, it’s probably correct to say that many aid workers make much less than difference than they think. I’ll be writing a lot more about this in future posts.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>409</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Daniel Gastfriend</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>dgastfriend@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/daniel-gastfriend</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-07-18 11:26:55</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I want to suggest a challenge to the replaceability argument. When you take a job, say, as an aid worker, the person who otherwise would have been given that job doesn't disappear from the job market. Let's imagine a clean, oversimplified model where you're chosen because your skills are more fitting for the job by some marginal amount than those of the next best person; they then drop down to the next best job for them, and displace someone else there who is slightly less capable than them. For the purposes of argument, let's assume that they stay within the field of aid, or at least the non-profit sector. Whoever would have taken that job then takes their next best option, and displaces another person who would have been marginally worse than them... this conceivably will happen all the way down the line, a cascading effect for some significant number of jobs. At each point in the sequence, each organization gets someone more talented than they would have otherwise (or else they wouldn't have hired them). By becoming an aid worker, you thus boost the human capital of all these organizations by some marginal amount.

While demonstrating the consequences of this empirically might be near impossible, you could argue that the expected value of this contribution to the non-profit sector is in the ballpark of the human capital you have to offer in the first place--which would support the more conventional intuition that we don't necessarily need to consider the replaceability effect when choosing jobs.

A counter argument to this, even if you accept the assumptions of my model, is that you can't  choose where the human capital "boost" goes--presumably it's distributed throughout a variety of organizations, many of whom may not be nearly as effective as ones you would otherwise donate to. This is definitely a valid argument, although if I'm right, we should still be wary of treating the replaceability argument as the final say in career ethics.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Common Mistakes In Careers Advice: When Should You Trust Sayings?</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/150-common-mistakes-in-careers-advice-when-should-you-trust-sayings</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[“Look after the pennies, and the pounds will look after themselves.”

Often in careers advice, as in life generally, you will be handed some proverb. But sometimes these sayings aren’t true, how can you know when to trust them? **A common mistake in career choice is to blindly accept common ideas like this without good reason.** 

You can’t always rely on hard studies being available, you have to rely on your intuitions a lot of the time. One way of using your intuition better that I’ve found effective is to follow this plan:

* Reverse the principle and see if the opposite idea makes sense
* Tell two stories, one to explain the principle, one to explain the reverse.
* Use these stories to find out when to trust the principle. 

**But first, is there a real problem here to solve?**

##Why isn’t normal intuition enough?

Your intuitions can convince you that ideas are believable even when they are false, or even contradicted by other beliefs. **It’s important to know how (un)trustworthy your intuitions are**. A typical person’s instincts about social situations are excellent. A typical person’s instincts about nuclear physics are terrible. For an autistic nuclear scientist the reverse might be true. In general, [without a lot of experience involving regular feedback](http://80000hours.org/blog/121-triumphs-of-intuition) intuitions tend not to be reliable.

But, even when you have good feedback, there is a special bias involved in common expressions that needs to be dealt with consciously.

The most common way our intuitions assess new ideas is by “trying them on”: trying out believing them and seeing how easy it is. If the idea is very easy to process then it will seem more likely to be true. 

This means our intuitions are biased by the way ideas are presented. It should be obvious that the fact something rhymes doesn’t make it true, but people are actually more likely to agree with a statement if it rhymes.[^1] 

![Just because it rhymes doesn’t mean it’s true](http://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/2011/4/1/c02a2860-9130-4c81-8b69-35a1d9bd2b63.jpg)

This bias can be dealt with by some techniques I’ll outline below. 

##Why does thinking about the opposite help

Law courts have two sides for a reason: finding one unbiased person is a lot harder than finding two people with opposite biases. You can deal with your own bias the same way. If you want to know whether to believe an aphorism or not, “try on” believing the opposite principle. But this isn’t always as easy as you might expect:

Quickly! Think of anyone from Asia other than Genghis Khan. 

If you’re like most people you will have spent most of your thinking time coming up with more and more information about Genghis Khan. Your intuitions are bad at understanding the idea of “not”. **It’s easier to believe things said as positive statements.** So when reversing a principle , don’t simply put “not” at the start. Turn it into a positive statement.

Take our example at the start: “look after the pennies, and the pounds will look after themselves.” Try to reverse it by saying “Don’t look after the pennies, the pounds won’t look after themselves”. Does that sound believable? Of course not. But how about “haggle more over the price of the house than the price of the wallpaper”? Does that sound believable? Yes. But now we have two statements, which mean exactly opposite things, both of which seem intuitively believable. 

The fact that how much we believe something depends so much on irrelevant factors like how it is phrased should make us worry about how much we trust sayings. We shouldn’t trust “look after the pennies” now that we’ve found a saying that’s believable but which means the opposite. How should we decide which of these sayings to trust?


##Explain it with a story

Alice went to a restaurant and ordered a steak. When it arrived it was crawling with maggots. Alice walked out of the restaurant.

Did Alice pay for the steak? You know that she didn’t: but nowhere in the story are you actually told that. **Stories contain a huge amount of implicit information.** Often by telling a story to explain something you can make inferences you wouldn’t have been able to before. 

“The best managers leave their office doors open”. If you think only about the principle you will leave your door open and do nothing else. But see how much more we can do with an explanation: “The best managers leave their office doors open, because the constant stream of people who come in and talk to them provides lots of new ideas, this makes them far more creative and so better”. With the story you can see that a policy of eating lunch with a new person every day would do the same thing. 

##Test it with a story

Remember the first point, our intuition tends to agree with things. With a story this is even more true. It is very important to also tell the story of the reversed principle. You can learn from this when a principle is justified. Take the manager example again:

“The best managers keep their doors shut, because that way the have very long uninterrupted stretches. Understanding a very complex strategy is like building a house of cards in your head. It’s only after a long time remembering all the connections that you can make progress. So the long stretches are far more valuable than the the same amount of time in small chunks.” 

This second story also makes a lot of sense. But it cannot be that both the principle and its opposite are true. **If you have two stories that say opposite things they must rely on different assumptions.** If you find these assumptions then you can work out when to trust the principle.

In the case of the manager we can see from these two stories that each approach is best only when working on certain kinds of job. Specifically we can predict that a closed door will help when the manager needs to deal with a large and complex strategy problem. We can likewise predict that the open door approach will work when the problem is how to create a novel solution for relatively simple problems.

##Conclusion

Many careers advice and charity sites have helpful advice in intuitively appealing sayings. **You should be careful in how you process this advice.**

Try and apply the above method to these common ideas, do they actually make intuitive sense.

Some of these interviews seem like they could be very useful and interesting to anyone wanting to make a difference in a research career, and the blog's editors, Elina Halonen (University of Turku, Finland) and Neda Kerimi (University of Uppsala, Sweden), have kindly agreed to let us repost some of them here on the 80,000 Hours blog.

First up: Richard Thaler, most famously the co-author of global best-seller [Nudge](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/0141040017): a book about how we can improve the decisions people make by presenting choices differently. He is currently Ralph and Dorothy Keller Distinguished Service Professor of Behavioural Science and Economics at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. His extensive research focuses broadly on using behavioural economics to tackle many of society's major problems.

**I wish someone had told me at the beginning of my career:** how to go about combining economics and psychology. There was no road map. Mostly trial and error with lots of errors.

**I most admire academically…** My greatest inspiration came from Kahneman and Tversky, my mentors who became my friends and collaborators. Danny is still a source of inspiration, going full speed at 78. They were a fantastic team because of their complementary skills, but they were both perfectionists in their different ways. I owe my career to them directly, but in some ways so does the entire field.

**The best research project I have worked on during my career…** This is like asking a parent to name his favorite child. Not fair. So I will fudge and name more than one. I think mental accounting is probably my best “idea”. Save More Tomorrow is my most important practical application. The book Nudge has reached the widest audience and had the most impact. But truth be told my favorite single paper is the one with Cade Massey on the NFL draft called the “Loser’s Curse”. The great thing about being an academic is that you can write a paper on anything. Certainly the paper that was the most fun to work on (or not work on) was the one with Eldar Shafir called “Invest Now, Drink Later, Spend Never”. Eldar and I didn’t work on it for a solid week in Venice one year. It is about the mental accounting of wine consumption. I still devote a lot of time to that problem!

**The worst research project I have worked on during my career…** There is nothing in print that I would want to take back. I have abandoned lots of projects. I believe in ignoring sunk costs. As I tell my MBA students: “Ignore sunk costs. Assume everyone else doesn’t.”

**The most amazing or memorable experience when I was doing research…** I gave a talk on the idea for Save More Tomorrow to a large (>500) group of 401(k) plan administrators in 1996 or so, thinking that at least one one of them would think enough of the idea to try it. Then nothing happened for several years. Very frustrating. Then out of the blue Shlomo Benartzi told me that someone he knew had tried it without even telling us, and the results were fantastic. That was exciting because once we could show people that the idea worked, it was (relatively) easy to get others to try it. Now it is used by millions of people, but we had to get the first employer to try it or we would still be wondering if it would really work.

**The one story I always wanted to tell but never had a chance…** No such thing. But I am putting all those stories into a book I am working on, so stay tuned. The working subtitle is “The Stories of Behavioral Economics”.

**A research project I wish I had done…** My phd thesis was on the value of saving a life. The idea was to estimate how much you had to pay people to get them to accept a small increase in risk. So, I did an econometrics exercise regressing wages on occupational mortality rates. But the really clean study to do, as suggested by my buddy Richard Zeckhauser, would be to get people to play Russian Roulette, with a machine gun with many, many chambers (say 10,000). Then tell people there are 5 bullets in the gun, how much would you pay to remove one, or accept to add one. For some reason, no human subject committee has ever been willing to approve this project. Can’t imagine why! (Before I get into trouble, this was intended as a joke.)

**If I wasn’t doing this, I would be…** Less happy. I feel lucky to have found a way to make a living that is so much fun to do. Who knows what else, but I did think about going to law school instead of economics graduate school. I don’t think I would have been a great lawyer though. I suffer from a diplomacy deficiency.

**The biggest challenge for our field in the next 10 years is…** I see two. First, JDMers need to learn to get out of the lab some of the time (and journal editors need to encourage such risky activity by applying appropriately different standards to field experiments). The stuff we study is too important and useful for it to be limited to the lab.

Second, I fear that the science-lab model in which increasing numbers of grad students are added to shrinkingly important papers in order to supply graduate students with enough publications to go on the job market. I think this trend stifles creativity and does not encourage students to do enough thinking on their own. More generally, I think psychologists are just publishing too many small papers. Look at the number of papers Kahneman and Tversky wrote that created and defined the field we now call judgment and decision making. The judgment stuff was really 3 papers plus the Science recapitulation. Then came prospect theory. Four blockbusters that led to a Nobel Prize. Not enough for tenure these days! Amos had a line about people that he felt wrote too many papers: “he publishes his waste basket”. I don’t think he would approve of the current state of affairs.

**My advice for young researchers at the start of their career is…** Work on your own ideas, not your advisor’s ideas (or at least in addition to her ideas). And spend more time thinking and less time reading. Too much reading leads people to think of small variations on existing studies. Admittedly my strategy of writing the paper first and only then reading the literature (or, more likely, letting the referees tell me what they think I should have read) is an extreme one, but it is better than trying to read everything. Try writing the first paper on some topic, not the tenth, and never the 50th.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier></dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2013-02-12 02:30:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status></item><item><title>How important is keeping your options open?</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/233-how-important-is-keeping-your-options-open</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/198/original/keeping_your_options_open_short.jpg?1373118008'><img alt="Keeping_your_options_open_short" class="image medium" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/198/medium/keeping_your_options_open_short.jpg?1373118008" /></a>

##Summary

* Keeping your options open is more important for effective altruists than in conventional career choice.
* Keeping your options open seems at least as important as the immediate impact of your job for most effective altruists.
* For some effective altruists, it’s likely to be several times more important than immediate impact.
* This means it’s highly important to adopt flexible career strategies. For instance, we think it’s important to focus on developing broadly useful capacities (career capital) that generally improve your ability to have impact in the future. It’s also a reason in favor of [Earning to Give](/earning-to-give), since donations are extremely flexible.


##Introduction

Why do so many elite graduates go into finance and consulting? At Princeton, for example, [more than 30% enter finance alone.](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/out-of-harvard-and-into-finance/)

The Aspen Impact Careers recently conducted research that attempted to work out why so many elite graduates enter finance and consulting (unpublished). They found several important factors, which chime with [the explanations proposed by commentators](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-16/harvard-liberal-arts-failure-is-wall-street-gain-commentary-by-ezra-klein.html) in the media. But they proposed that the single biggest factor was a desire to keep options open. Entry level consulting and finance jobs successfully market themselves as a great general purpose training and a ticket to all sorts of other jobs in the future. The same is true of Teach for America. The demand is real, and all three have been rewarded with strong applications.

From an entirely personal point of view, it makes sense to prioritise keeping your options open in the first couple of years of your career. You have little idea what you’ll enjoy or be good at when you start working, or what opportunities will come your way in the future. A good way to deal with the problem is to take the job that most keeps your options open. That way you can learn more about what you enjoy, but retain the ability to switch into another job if it turns out you don’t enjoy your first one.

For effective altruists, keeping your options open is *even more* important. Not only do you need to take into account all the extra information you can learn about what suits you personally, you need to take into account information about in which cause you can make the largest contribution, and which cause is most effective.

Imagine you’re ending your career this year instead of starting it. When you started working, 40 years ago, the big issues of today were not on the table. AIDs and climate change were not regarded as huge problems. The big issue was nuclear war. No one could have predicted with any certainty which issues would become important over the next decades.

Our future is similarly unpredictable. Indeed, as technological change and communication speed up, we might even expect the future to be less predictable than it was back then.

Not only can the world change, but (i) your evidence about which cause is most effective can change as you do more research and (ii) your beliefs about what’s valuable can change. Putting all of these together, it seems reasonable to expect that you’ll want to switch causes in the future. Since [some causes are much more effective than others](http://80000hours.org/blog/94-how-to-do-one-year-of-work-in-four-hours), the ability to switch looks like it matters a great deal for your expected future impact.

If keeping your options open is highly important, then we should aim to pick the most flexible career paths.


##For effective altruists, how important is keeping your options open compared to your immediate impact?

Let’s review the key arguments in favor of keeping your options open compared to maximising your immediate impact.


###The increasing effectiveness of the most effective cause

It seems to us that the main reason to keep your options open is the expectation that we’ll have much better information about which cause is most effective in the near future. This is because in the last few years a systematic research program aimed at identifying the best cause has started.

The best expertise in prioritisation research is currently focused on evaluating funding opportunities rather than career opportunities. I recently polled several people who have been involved with prioritisation research at the Centre for Effective Altruism on how much more effective they expect Givewell’s top recommendation to be in two years. They gave me answers ranging from 50-300% and several said they expected increases of that order to continue for significantly more than two years.

If this is also true for the causes you can pursue in your career, then if you are unable to switch causes in two years, you’ll be losing 30-70% of your annual impact. If this rate of compounding continues over 10 years, then someone who can switch causes will have 6 times more impact over the next 10 years than someone who can’t. This suggests that keeping your options open is several times more important than your immediate impact.

These estimates are for the increasing effectiveness of donations. Can we expect increases of this size for the causes you can pursue with your human capital rather than with money? If your strategy for impact involves filling a funding gap, either via fundraising, influencing budgets or [earning to give](earning-to-give) then the estimates for the increasing effectiveness of Givewell recommendations will apply directly. 

With the other sorts of impact you could have in your career by applying human capital, the answer is less clear. One reason to be optimistic is that very little work has been done on the impact of different careers, so it might be easy to make progress in working out their effectiveness. In that case, it will be better to stay flexible. One reason to be pessimistic is that it seems likely to be harder to evaluate career opportunities for impact than donation opportunities. It’s unclear to me where these two considerations balance out, but I find it hard to imagine that in a world where we learn so much about how best to spend money, we won’t learn a great deal that is relevant to working out the best way to spend human capital.


###Better information on what you’re good at

Since there are no highly reliable general ways to predict which types of job different people will be good at, we need to use trial and error. After several years of work, you’ll have much better information about what types of job best suits you, and thus where you’ll have the most impact.

If you stay flexible, then you’ll be able to switch into a different job in which you can have more impact.


###Learning about your values

In addition to gaining more evidence about the world, you may come to change your values. This could be especially likely if you haven’t given much thought to your values before. Certain changes in your values can have large effects on which cause you think is most important. For instance, if you change your opinion about the importance of animal welfare compared to human welfare, then you might switch from supporting Givewell recommendations to [EAA recommendations](www.effectiveanimalactivism). This reason to keep your options open can be just as powerful as further cost-effectiveness research.


###Immediate impact is good for your motivation

Against these three points, it’s much more inspiring to have impact straight away rather than delay it to the future. If you worry about becoming demotivated over time, then it might be better to prioritise having some immediate impact.


###Learning about effectiveness from doing

Also against these points, to the extent that learning about which causes are most effective comes from trying things out, we need some people to keep trying things in order for others to learn from them. This would reduce the extent to which your individual flexibility is important.

However, I tend to think that the majority of extra information about which causes are important will come from more research, not from trying stuff out, so this is not a significant consideration.



##Summing up

1. It strikes me that for most effective altruist minded people, keeping options will open will at least have similar importance to immediate impact. 
2. For people who think the state of career prioritisation research will advance as much as the estimates of the rate of improvement in Givewell’s top recommendation above, then **keeping options open is likely to be several times more important than immediate impact.**


##How can you best keep your options open?

I’ll explore this in a future post, but there’s one confusing point I’d like to clear up immediately. Often the best way to keep your options is to have a large immediate impact. The image we have of ‘keeping options open’ is being cautious and noncommittal. In contrast, if you really want options, then the best thing to do is often to build career capital. That means going out there and being successful, gaining valuable skills and meeting lots of people. So, in practice, keeping your options open often doesn’t look as different from maximising your immediate impact as you might expect. Nevertheless, there are trade-offs, and we’ll explore some particularly good ways of keeping your options open in a later post.

There's definitely a significant risk of sacrificing your overall impact/earnings if you hop around from career to career too much in an attempt to keep your options open. I don't think that "hopping from field to field" is quite what Ben had in mind when he talked about keeping your options open though. What he's suggesting is focusing the early years of your career on building human capital: that is, developing valuable skills and experience that will position you well to take on a variety of different paths later on. Which is quite different: rather than changing careers a lot you want to focus on working in careers that allow you to become proficient in areas that you expect to have broad applicability. Framed in this way, I think keeping your options open is also much more compatible with the deliberate practice you mention, which is definitely important.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1222</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Tim Dettmers</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>tim.dettmers@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/tim-dettmers</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-07-09 19:36:28</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I find this reasoning rather unconvincing: It was shown by many pieces of research that you can only achieve something that is merely good when you are open and changing careers often; but you can never achieve something great (e.g. in science). I have something like vaccines, the internet, and the green revolution in my mind that would have never been achieved by someone who hopped from field to field. I think changing companies or institutes is great but when you change careers often you can never accumulated the 10000 hours of deliberate practise you will need to become very good at something. 
So my hypothesis is that being closed to new careers and focusing on one thing might yield higher impact over time than being open to new careers.
A way to test your hypothesis that being open to career changes yields higher impact, is to take all those people that started in finance (and then switched) and gauge their average accumulated wealth per person (and thus impact through donations) and compare this to the average impact that highly specialised persons had that accumulated over 10000 hours of practice in their respective field (plus their average accumulated wealth). 
I guess that you would find that both paths would yield on average similar impact. 
I would hypothesise that one would find the lowest impact in the group of people that make few to an intermediate amount of changes in careers rather than many or none.
Maybe the best is to hop careers until you find something you can be really good at?

What is still bothering me, though, is how the use of the peak mental ability relates to the overall impact one can achieve in one's life. If one sees one's early career as a window to improve prospects to attain a higher impact in the future, this creates some conflict: Mental ability peaks in the early twenties; brain reorganization of the prefrontal cortex is completed at age 25; mental ability declines quite rapidly from age 30; careers peak at age 35. It is on average still better to focus on a variety of useful skills or is it better to focus on a single useful skill? My essential question is, if there is a time when it will be too late to become really good at one thing. In mathematics they say when you are aged 30 it will be too late for discovering new things – and although there might be more time in other fields – this might be quite relevant for one's overall impact, especially if one needs about 10 years of deliberate practice to become good at something.
For example if one really wants to discover that vaccine that is so desperately needed, one might have a higher impact by focusing on one skill, e.g. understanding cell biology very well, rather than on generally useful skills. ]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>WikiCharities, for those who haven't seen it</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/13-wikicharities-for-those-who-haven-t-seen-it</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[Just a quick note:

In December we conducted the first review of our progress as a full-time organisation. In a spirit of transparency, we’re posting the results on our site.

The review consisted of:

1. A detailed report on our stated goals, our delivery on these goals, our impact over the period, our goals for the future and a proposed budget prepared by the Executive Director. 

2. This report was brought to the three trustees of the Centre for Effective Altruism (the registered charity which 80,000 Hours is a part of) who decide whether to approve the budget.

3. It was also brought to the three members of our Advisory Committee. These are three supporters of 80,000 Hours who aren’t involved in our day-to-day operation who provide an outside view on our strategy.

What were my main conclusions as Executive Director?

###Main Achievements

* We managed the transition from being a volunteer organisation, to having a team of five staff and interns who are executing our business plan and report very high levels of satisfaction.

* We clarified our concept to one focused on providing career advice, and re-wrote our website and materials. This contributed to a doubling of key engagement rates (e.g. number of people attending our events and % of website visitors becoming members).

* We tested basic content on our philosophy and high impact paths on the website and in Oxford outreach. This included about 20,000 words of web content, 60 blog posts and 4 new lectures. We found we were able to roughly triple our online reach.

* We started with an overly ambitious and unclear plan. Over the period we increased the focus of our internal goals, and then wrote a new 50 page business plan based on our outreach to date and more market research. We introduced a ‘lean start-up’ style content development model (a high feedback approach, often regarded as best practice among entrepreneurs). One probable mistake in our strategy was not investing this time in strategy at the start of the period, though doing more outreach sooner had significant benefits.

* We founded Effective Animal Activism with an investment of under £1,500, which has now secured over $30,000 of external funding.

* There were some problems in effectively coordinating the central operations team that’s shared with Giving What We Can, but we addressed this by clarifying its responsibilities and delegating more power to the Executive Directors from the Trustees.


###What do we need to work on in the future?

* We need to implement a more systematic approach to planning and testing our content to ensure we create something useful. Our current best-guess is that we need to tilt our content towards more concrete, actionable advice about how to have an impact.

* We need to continue to work on establishing ourselves as a robust organisation with a good team, clear vision, and good culture.

* As we knew from the start of the project, we’ll need to start better monitoring of our impact, so we can best focus our content. In particular, collecting and analysing data can potentially provide the answers to many specific concerns shared by myself and our advisers, for instance, whether weakening the membership conditions was a boost to the community overall.


Our Advisory Board didn’t find any major disagreements with our reports. Their key piece of advice was to focus even more on making ourselves robust as an organisation, for instance (i) creating systems to transfer knowledge to new staff to protect against losing a key person and (ii) building a motivated, coordinated team. We also discussed whether it made sense to de-emphasise the importance of Earning to Give to our content, though they did not express a strong opinion either way. In conclusion, they published the following statement:

*On December 8th the Advisory Committee of 80,000 Hours had their first meeting, via video conference. The committee was Alex Flint, Lisanne Pueschel, and Jeff Kaufman. Ben Todd and Will MacAskill of 80,000 Hours were also present. Before the meeting the committee members individually looked over two documents provided by 80,000 Hours: their six month review and business plan. During the meeting we reviewed 80,000 Hours’ work over the past six months and talked about its plans for the next six. While we had some questions and suggestions, especially around earning to give, for the most part we were very happy with 80,000 Hours’ progress and plans.*



Similarly, the trustees of Centre for Effective Altruism, Toby Ord, Will MacAskill and Nick Beckstead, were pleased with our progress. They approved our budget and issued the following statement:

*We came out of the review meeting impressed with 80,000 Hours' progress so far and hopeful about the future. We were particularly impressed with the amount of work that has gone into refining the concept of just what it is that 80,000 Hours is offering, with their willingness to change their approach in the face of evidence, and with the professionalism of the events they run. Our concerns at the moment include possible loss of focus due to the new less demanding membership conditions, and room for improvement in the website (notably in getting the message across more clearly and engagingly on the front page and having blog posts that are less abstract). We are looking forward to seeing how 80,000 Hours tackles these concerns and expands its operations over the next 6 months.*

##Why you need to make estimates

Trying to answer questions about the impact of a career is difficult, and trying to decide between different career options is even harder. If I asked you *‘How many people will benefit from research into anti-malarial vaccination?’* or *‘How many malaria nets would a £1000 donation to the Against Malaria Foundation get?’*, your first answer will probably be that you don’t know. After this you will probably try to Google the answer, but in most cases the information that you need is either not easily accessible or it would cost you a lot of time and money to find it.

Once you realise this, you need to make a choice; do you give up or [do you estimate the answer?](http://80000hours.org/blog/4-estimation-is-the-best-we-have) If you consider a question or a decision important enough to search for data, chances are that giving up is not an option.

In this post we are going to look at how to make an estimate of a quantity you’re uncertain about. In order to do this we will cover the following things:
* Making your estimate
* Is your estimate a good one?
* Are you overconfident?
* Calibration: overcoming your overconfidence
* Case Study: When did Einstein win his Nobel Prize?
* How to use estimations

After going over the above, you will be able to make useful estimates for quantities that relate to your career. A second [post](http://80000hours.org/blog/171-how-to-make-estimates-part-ii) will then examine the more complex task of how to compare and combine different estimates.

##Making your estimate

Let’s consider a simple question for which the answer is known;  *In which year did Einstein win the Nobel Prize for Physics?*

This question might seem impossible to answer without looking online. We could pick a single year, say 1935, but picking a random year probably won’t give us the correct answer and isn’t very useful if it’s wrong. 

When making an estimate it is much better to give a range of values that the answer probably lies within. So we could say that we think Einstein won the Nobel Prize between 1925 and 1945.

But what exactly do you mean by this range? Are you *absolutely certain* the date lies in this range? Even better than just citing a range, cite a range and say *how likely* you think it is that the answer is in that range. To do this we assign a probability to the range that we have suggested. People often aim for an estimation which has a 90% probability of containing the correct answer. A range of values with a given probability of containing an answer is called a Confidence Interval (CI). We will assume that our range of 1925-1945 is our 90% CI - that means we think there’s a 90% chance that Einstein won the Nobel Prize between these dates.

##Is your estimate a good one?

If we look at our 90% CI, we picked it fairly arbitrarily. Do you *really* think that there is a 90% chance that the answer is between this range? It turns out that most people are bad at making estimates because they are [over confident](http://80000hours.org/blog/124-do-you-think-you-re-better-than-average) and most of the ranges they choose are too narrow. Fortunately there are some simple tips for improving your ability to pick accurate confidence intervals and we will now cover these. 

##Are you overconfident?

Before we look at how to improve our estimates, we need to check what our starting point is. To find out whether you are overconfident or not write down the lower and upper bounds of your 90% CI for the following 10 questions:

>1. In 1938 a British steam locomotive set a new speed record by going how fast (mph)?
>2. In what year did Sir Isaac Newton publish the Universal Laws of Gravitation?
>3. How many inches long is a typical business card?
>4. The Internet (then called “Arpanet”) was established as a military communications system in what year?
>5. In what year was William Shakespeare born?
>6. What is the air distance between New York and Los Angeles (miles)?
>7. What percentage of a square could be covered by a circle of the same width?
>8. How old was Charlie Chaplin when he died?
>9. How many pounds did the first edition of the book *‘How to measure anything?’* weigh?
>10. The TV show *Gilligan’s Island* first aired on what date?

You can find the answers[^1] to these questions in the notes at the bottom of this post. If the estimates you gave really are your 90% CI, you should get around 9 of the answers correct. If you find you got 7 or fewer answers correct, as most people do, then you were over confident with your answers. In reality the ranges you gave were too narrow, probably representing a 60% or 70% CI instead.

##Calibration: overcoming your overconfidence

The good news is that you can train yourself to improve your estimation of possibilities and to reduce your overconfidence.

Douglas Hubbard[^2] has carried out research into how well a number of techniques for improving estimation abilities actually work and he found that 90% of people can improve their accuracy in just half a day. The four techniques that are most effective when combined are described below and will then be used in a case study to improve our estimation for *Einstein’s Nobel Prize*.

###Equivalent bet:
For each estimate imagine that you are betting $1000 on the answer being within your 90% CI. Now compare this to betting $1000 on a spinner where 90% of the time you win and 10% of the time you lose. Would you prefer to take a spin? If so, your range is too small and you need to increase it. If you decide to answer the question your range is too large and you need to reduce it. If you don’t mind whether you answer the question or take a spin then it really is your 90% CI.

###Absurdity Test:
Start with an absurdly large range, maybe from minus infinity to plus infinity, and then begin reducing it based upon things you know to be highly unlikely or even impossible.

###Avoid Anchoring:
Anchoring[^3] occurs when you think of a single answer to the question and then add an error around this answer; this often leads to ranges which are too narrow. Using the absurdity test is a good way to counter problems brought on by anchoring; another is to change how you look at your 90% CI. For a 90% CI there is a 10% chance that the answer lies outside your estimate, and if you split this there is a 5% chance that the answer is above your upper bound and a 5% chance that the answer is below your lower bound. By treating each bound separately, rephrase the question to read *‘is there a 95% chance that the answer is above my lower bound?’*. If the answer is no, then you need to increase or decrease the bound as required. You can then repeat this process for the other bound.

###Pros and cons:
Identify two pros and two cons for the range that you have given to help clarify your reasons for making this estimate.

Once you have used these techniques you can make another equivalent bet to check whether your new estimate is your 90% CI.

The important thing with these techniques is to practice them, testing yourself on further questions[^4], assessing yourself as you go and attempting to improve between tests. Over time you should see that your estimates for a 90% CI move closer to being correct 90% of the time. 

Once you reach the point at which your 90% CI’s are correct 90% of the time you can consider yourself calibrated.

For a more in depth explanation on how to calibrate yourself as well as even more questions with which to test yourself we would recommend looking at Hubbard’s book, *How to Measure Anything*.

##Case Study: When did Einstein win his Nobel Prize?

At the beginning of this post we initially estimated that Einstein won his Nobel Prize between 1925 and 1945, but we will now apply the calibration techniques to this estimate to check it and if possible improve our 90% CI.

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/115/original/Part_1-_Skeleton.png?1364487101'><img alt="Part_1-_skeleton" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/115/large/Part_1-_Skeleton.png?1364487101" /></a>

As well as following the flowchart above we also note two additional pros and cons:
* Pro: Einstein was influential in the interwar period, advising Roosevelt to set up the Manhattan Project.
* Pro: Period falls between two points at which we know he wasn’t alive.
* Con: Some of his theories have been tested in manned space flight, so Einstein may have won his Nobel after experimental results were obtained.
* Con: We aren’t sure that he wasn’t still alive and working in the period between 1960 and 1989.

After taking this into account we produce our final 90% CI of 1890-1960. In fact, Einstein won his Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, very close to the centre of our estimated range.

##How to use estimates

We have now covered how to make an estimate for simple problems as well as learning the four techniques which can ensure that our estimate is accurate. In [Part II](http://80000hours.org/blog/171-how-to-make-estimates-part-ii) we will focus on how to combine estimates to deal with more complex issues as well as how to compare two different estimates when making a decision.

To calibrate for under-confidence the basic method is to try more questions. In the long run one in ten answers should lie outside of your 90% confidence interval. Getting 10 out of 10 within the interval could just be a little lucky, so isn't enough to conclude, but if you got 99 out of 100 within the 90% interval it would be a sign your intervals were a bit too wide.

That's quite a lot of work, though. Luckily, there are some shortcuts you can take, if you're willing to give slightly more information about your estimates (and make some mild assumptions). The basic idea is to give not just a single confidence interval, but a distribution representing your uncertainty. Then you can see how well your observed accuracy fits your stated accuracy.

A reasonable (or at least not terrible) starting point is usually to assume your estimate is a log-normal distribution. If you just give your median estimate and one other percentile estimate, or a single confidence interval, that's enough to work out the parameters. Then you can read off other implied confidence intervals. So you can for example check that in the region of half of your answers fall outside of your implied 50% confidence interval. (I wrote a blog post about some related issues at http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-01-10/making-practical-estimates-in-cases-of-large-uncertainty and there's a spreadsheet tool for imputing the parameters of your distribution from a confidence interval which should be going on the GWWC website at some point.)]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1030</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Owen CB</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>scatha@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-04-27 20:38:41</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The start of my comment got cut for some reason.

After the shocking massacre in Connecticut it looks like gun control is going to draw a lot of attention from Obama and Congress this year. This got me thinking about how important gun control might be as a political cause. The potential good achieved by focussing on this policy is in large part determined by the damage done by guns in the first place. In that light, does it deserve it?

A natural measure of the importance of the problem is the number of years of healthy life lost due to gun violence. At  the moment there are a bit over 8,000 murders with firearms each year in the US, some two thirds of the total. If we guess that the typical age of death from gun violence is 30, then the average survivor would have enjoyed another 50 years or so of healthy life. Firearm homicides would than lead to the loss of 400,000 years of healthy life each year. We would then have to add health problems among survivors of gun violence. To confirm that these figures are sensible I looked up the World Health Organisation’s Global Burden of Disease, which suggest ‘intentional violence’ as a whole cost the US and Canada about 1,100,000 years of healthy life each year. Two thirds of this would be 650,000 years, a figure which amounts to about 0.8% of the total burden of disease and injury in the US.

Another even larger problem than murder – at least as far as years of healthy life lost - is suicide. Easy access to guns makes suicide attempts more likely to succeed. The US suicide rate is 12 per 100,000; tragically high, though sadly unexceptional by international standards. If the typical suicide victim would have lived another 45 healthy years, this amounts to an annual burden of 1,600,000 each year, roughly the WHO’s figure. [^1]  Firearms are used for about half of these suicides, so we’ll say they have a burden of 800,000 years of healthy life, or about 1% of the total burden of disease and injury.

How much could the US hope to reduce these figures? Of course the relationship between the number of guns and violence is contested, and I don’t really want to get drawn into that debate. I will just assume, for the sake of argument, that gun control policies could indeed help reduce violence. For that purpose, let’s imagine it could get firearm violence and suicide down to the average of other OECD countries. [1] Doing so would reduce the gun death rate (and I will assume injuries too) by 80% from ~10 to ~2 per 100,000. This is wildly optimistic given the other drivers of violence and suicide in the US, and the timidity of any likely gun control laws under the Second Amendment. Even if guns did become hard to access, we would expect to see substitution to other weapons. Nonetheless, it offers a useful upper bound.

An 80% drop in firearm deaths and injuries would prevent the loss of 1.15 million years of healthy life each year, or around 1.4 per cent of all the damage done by disease and injury in the US. This falls inconveniently between ‘very little’ and ‘quite a bit’. How can we put this figure in perspective? One option would be to consider how much people claim to value their lives, while another would be to compare it to other available options for saving lives. Here I will use the latter to give some idea of how focussing on gun control compares to other policies or causes that might improve the health of Americans.

How much does it cost to save a life in the US?  The NHS in Britain conveniently uses £30,000 (around $US50,000) for each year of healthy life as the highest price at which a treatment is worth funding. The US has no central body for making these decisions, so no generic ‘marginal cost’ exists. A conclusion of the classic paper, "Five-hundred life-saving interventions and their cost-effectiveness", is that the cost of extending lives varies across several orders of magnitude depending on the approach you take. Nonetheless, many interventions in medicine and general safety fell between $5-50,000 for a year of life, at least in the mid-90s. A quick search turns up vaccination of US girls against HPV, which buys a year of healthy life for about $44,000, total knee arthroplasty for $18,300, HIV screening for under $25,000 and flu vaccination at $8,000-52,000. The availability of all of these could be expanded. At a rounded $50,000 figure, the equivalent of 1.15 million years of healthy life could be saved for $57 billion, or 0.38% of US GDP – a significant sum, though under a fifth of long run annual growth. By comparison, the US Federal Government already spends about 24% of US GDP, and all healthcare spending accounts for some 15%. Based on [Robin Hanson’s work](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/07/medical-market-failures.html) on the inefficacy of much US healthcare spending, redirecting some of that enormous budget to truly life-saving activities would go a long way.

If American activists or voters currently preoccupied with gun control were willing to look farther afield in their desire to prevent unnecessary death, directing government spending to provide bed nets to protect children in developing countries against malaria could save 30,000 kids for a meagre $70 million, or 0.00000046% of GDP. Sadly, the effectiveness and size of US foreign aid is barely discussed.

Of course this health story is not the full picture of the damage done by gun violence. We ought also consider the:

* Costs incurred in trying to stay safe
* Costs of caring for the injured
* Loss of human capital from adults dying
* Resulting distress and fear
* Reduced urbanisation as a result of crime (which lowers productivity, among other things).
* I would appreciate attempts to quantify these costs but don’t have time to pursue them myself right now. I would note in passing that many other interventions that improve health and safety would also reduce these harms to some extent.

My interpretation of the above is that gun violence is a serious issue in the US. It is not being blown out of proportion like shark attacks or terrorism. At the same time, the impact of guns on US health-span is modest, and lower than many common and avoidable diseases or accidents which fail to inspire a national conversation. Guns have become a hot issue because of their grisly and visible results, as well as fierce identity politics, rather than the absolute scale of the damage they do. If the main goal of gun control advocates were to save lives, their cause would not stand out as low-hanging fruit, especially if they cared about foreigners as well as Americans. Given the host of major problems facing the US, the limited attention of Congress and the White House, and the improbability of achieving a significant reduction in the number of dangerous weapons available, it is not a cause I would jump on.

[^1]: Some would say that a death by suicide isn’t as bad as a murder, because someone who is prevented from committing suicide probably has a low quality of life. There is some truth to this but I will ignore it, consistent with my desire to define an upper bound.

An assumption which I want to point out is the 800,000 years of healthy life from suicide prevention. Of course it's an upper bound but it just seems a little too extreme, as being denied access to firearms will force people to suicide in different ways (perhaps suicide prevention having an effect of 300,000 years - I think that's optimistic too, personally). Makes your points even more important though!]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1031</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Carl Armbruster</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>mazzaroth_c_a@hotmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/carl-armbruster</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-04-28 05:11:27</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I used to be a big advocate for firearms.

To what extent should you set yourself career goals in advance? On the one hand, plans and goals provide direction and motivation. Especially if you care about really making a difference, you don’t want to be just stabbing in the dark. Yet at the same time, the world around you is constantly changing, as are you - isn’t it naive to plan for the future when you have no real idea what the job market will look like, what the world’s biggest needs might be, and what you might want personally?

Although there’s little research explicitly looking at the effects of career planning, there’s a lot of literature on the effects of planning and goal setting on business and employee performance, which seems pretty relevant. So we decided to explore the research a bit further and see what it might suggest about the best way to approach thinking about your career.

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/150/original/marketing-plan.jpg?1369044572'><img alt="Marketing-plan" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/150/large/marketing-plan.jpg?1369044572" /></a>

In summary:

* On first glance, the research appears contradictory: there’s evidence that goal setting provides motivation and increases effort and persistence. Yet elsewhere it’s been suggested that goals can be damaging to performance by narrowing focus, promoting risk taking, and even encouraging unethical behaviour.

* A big part of the problem seems to be that there’s a huge amount of environmental uncertainty in the cases studied: the information needed to plan appropriately is often unavailable and constantly changing.
* Having an idea of what you’d like to achieve in the future is useful, but long terms goals shouldn’t be too fixed or specific. Rather than a detailed plan, start with a vague vision of what you’re aiming to achieve, but think of this as merely a “best guess”, which will very likely change as you progress and learn more. I’ll talk about the specifics of how you might do this more in an upcoming post.

##The virtues of planning

In “Motivate Employee Performance through Goal Setting”, Gary Latham provides a nice summary of thousands of studies conducted over the past few decades, looking at the influence of goal setting on performance in the workplace. The conclusion drawn is that *setting challenging, specific goals improves performance*, increasing effort and persistence.[^1] Having goals is proposed as single best explanation of why certain employees perform better than others.[^2] Goals also provide a measure of how you’re doing and an opportunity for feedback which is itself important for motivation.[^3]

Reading this, we might assume that planning your career in advance by setting goals is a great idea, even essential: it provides you with direction, something to aim for, and a means of tracking your progress. All this seems fairly intuitive and something [careers advisors have long been talking about.](http://www.prospects.ac.uk/features_career_planning.htm) So why might planning your career not be a good idea? 

##When planning backfires

Some more recent research highlights some serious potential downsides to over-planning and too-specific goal setting. In a paper entitled [“Goals Gone Wild”](http://www.exed.hbs.edu/assets/Documents/goal-setting.pdf), researchers at Harvard Business School propse some potential negative side effects of overdoing planning and goal-setting:

* **Narrowing focus:** Whilst previous research emphasises the importance of having specific goals to provide motivation, this paper warns that overly specific goals may blind people to important issues and opportunities that appear unrelated to the goal.[^4],[^5]

* **Emphasis on immediate performance:** Goal setting can arguably prompt people to engage in myopic short-term behaviour that is damaging in the long term.[^6]

* **Promoting risky or unethical behaviour:** Goals that are inappropriately challenging, or have an inappropriate time frame, may therefore cause people to engage in risky or unethical behaviour to achieve them.[^7], [^8]

* **Reduced motivation:** Overly challenging goals, if not met, could plausibly result in dissatisfaction, and therefore actually a reduction in motivation.[^9]

* **Inhibiting learning:** if the focus is constantly on performance, people are less likely to consider alternative methods or learn how to perform a task.[^10]

It’s unclear how strong the evidence is for these detrimental effects of goal setting. In a [response](http://wmv.aom.org/uploadedFiles/Publications/AMP/Feb09GoalsettingbyLockeandLatham.pdf) to the “Goals Gone Wild” paper, Edwin Locke and Gary Latham criticise its methodology, claiming it relies on mainly anecdotal evidence and its conclusions are overly emotionally charged. Nonetheless, the message that goals need to be set carefully and appropriately if they are to be useful and not detrimental seems worth some consideration.

##The problem of environmental uncertainty

If having a career plan and setting oneself goals is only problematic when the goals set are “inappropriate” in some way, why not just make sure the goals set are appropriate? But knowing how to set appropriate goals is incredibly difficult in practice, because the world around us is both highly uncertain and constantly changing. There’s a lot of information we need to set appropriate career goals that is either unavailable or may quickly become obsolete due to rapid changes in the environment. 

One study in particular suggests that in rapidly changing environments, people work better without setting specific goals. In one experiment, students were paid to make toys, with the prices changing continuously and without warning. Students who were asked to “do their best” performed significantly better than those who set performance goals in advance.[^11] However, [adding short-term goals that are instrumental in achieving long term goals resulted in improved performance](http://www.themanagementor.com/kuniverse/kmailers_universe/sm_kmailers/SHRM_0602_2.htm). This suggests that in some circumstances, goal setting may be helpful, or at very least improved, if both short-term and long-term goals are used and related in an appropriate way.

Obviously the conclusion to be drawn from all this will depend on the career path: in some there may be a reasonable degree of certainty. If your goal is to become a doctor, for example, what you need to achieve to get there is fairly certain and unlikely to change as you work your way towards that goal. In this situation, having a plan for getting there is clearly sensible. But for many types of high impact career, there is no clear path to the ultimate goal, and the best route there will likely change multiple times as you progress towards it: so having a static plan in advance won’t help you much. If you want to set up a social enterprise to address some societal problem, for example, specific goals seem much more likely to hinder than help you.

##What should you do?

* Start by spending some time reflecting on your fundamental values and motivations, as these provide you with something (relatively!) constant to assess your progress by as everything else around you changes.[^12] 

* Everything should be a hypothesis, a “best guess”, which is subject to revision as you learn more.

* Having some kind of long-term goal or vision helps to provide motivation, but shouldn’t be overly specific to avoid narrowing focus.

* The closer to the present your goals are, and the more certain the path to them is, the more specific they should be. 

* You should be constantly looking to identify what the key uncertainties are affecting your next decision, and finding ways to reduce them by seeking out new information.

I'm not sure goal setting has to be either/or... you could set a goal, but allow yourself to revise it if you later realized it was the wrong thing to focus on.  A bigger thing I've run in to with goal setting is the planning fallacy: I seem to set deadlines for myself that I don't end up being able to achieve, which hurts my morale and sours me on goal setting.  Maybe I need to set goals without deadlines?]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>How to double your donations with no extra effort</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/168-how-to-double-your-donations-with-no-extra-effort</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/111/original/donate_matchinggifts.jpg?1363770295'><img alt="Donate_matchinggifts" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/111/large/donate_matchinggifts.jpg?1363770295" /></a>


80,000 hours is all about making a difference in an effective way and one of the most effective things you can do is donate to a cost effective charity. There has been some talk of [matching donations](http://80000hours.org/blog/34-why-doesn-t-everyone-use-matching-donations) and how it might not always increase how much money is ultimately donated. But there is a type of matching that can be very powerful. 

Some companies offer large matching contributions and sometimes offer more than a dollar per every dollar donated. Some companies also offer [grant money](http://www.doublethedonation.com/VolunteerGrants.html) for volunteer hours or matching donations for participating in walks/runs/events for charity, and also match gifts made by retirees and/or spouses. If you're pursuing an Earning to Give career, then a good matching scheme could be even more important than what industry you enter. In many cases it's probably easier to find an employer who matches than to earn a much bigger salary.

##How can you find out which companies do matching? 

Luckily there is a large and extensive list of hundreds of companies for both the [US](http://www.oxfam.ca/node/2268 ) and the [UK](http://www.ucs.org.uk/matching-gifts.html) (in fact [65% of Fortune 500 companies](http://www.doublethedonation.com/Content/Statistics.html) offer matching gift programs). Additionally, many companies not on this list can be [searched](http://www.doublethedonation.com/Database/CorporateSearch.php) or will offer matching donations if asked.


##What are the best matching schemes out there?

Some of the [best matching schemes](http://www.doublethedonation.com/Content/TopCorporateGivingPrograms.html) include large companies such as:

1. [Microsoft](http://www.doublethedonation.com/Database/CorporateSearchDetails.php?ID=54) matches $12,000
2. [General Electric](http://www.doublethedonation.com/Database/CorporateSearchDetails.php?ID=34) matches $50,000
3. [Johnson and Johnson](http://www.doublethedonation.com/Database/CorporateSearchDetails.php?ID=55) match up to $10,000 at a 1:2 ratio
4. [Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.org/about/craigslist_is_hiring) matches up to 10% of your salary at a 1:3  ratio 
5. [Soros](http://www.doublethedonation.com/Database/CorporateSearchDetails.php?ID=328) fund management matches up to $300,000 at a 1:3 ratio 


##How might this change your career?
Bill has decided to take an earning to give career in finance. He is debating between [Goldman Sachs](http://www.doublethedonation.com/Database/CorporateSearchDetails.php?ID=65) and their competitors. After learning that Goldman Sachs has a large matching donation system, he chooses to work there and ends up donating an extra $20,000 to his favorite charity.

Jane works a government job with summers off. She routinely donates $5,000-$10,000 to her charity. But after learning about matching donations she realizes that she could get a part time summer job at [The Gap](http://www.doublethedonation.com/Database/CorporateSearchDetails.php?ID=144) and they will match her donations, increasing her donations by $10,000. And she will earn a little extra money. Not bad for a part time summer job.

Tom is a student and wants to get a job for a little spending money. He does not have a strong preference as to what minimum wage job to get but he does donate around $1,000 a year to charity. He checks out what jobs offer matching donations and finds a large list of jobs he could easily apply for, ranging from [Dell](http://www.doublethedonation.com/Database/CorporateSearchDetails.php?ID=57) to [Kraft](http://www.doublethedonation.com/Database/CorporateSearchDetails.php?ID=66), to even [Mcdonald's](http://www.doublethedonation.com/Database/CorporateSearchDetails.php?ID=105), [Pizza Hut](http://www.doublethedonation.com/Database/CorporateSearchDetails.php?ID=172) and [Verizon](http://www.doublethedonation.com/Database/CorporateSearchDetails.php?ID=31).

In summary, corporate matching could be a great way to increase your impact, so [search](http://www.doublethedonation.com/Database/CorporateSearch.php) if your current work matches, and keep it in mind when selecting a place to work in the future!

It's Adam Weinger, the President of Double the Donation (the source of much of the information in the article). 

First off, let me say the article is very well written and highlights the positive impact these programs can have. The benefits are actually offered as a way to attract talented individuals and should be considered when determining where to work. 

I'm also not sure of the legalities of passing donations through friends, but I will say that from a corporate standpoint, it's definitely frowned upon. 

That being said, there are a number of companies which match the fundraising efforts of employees. Typically the match limits are lower, but they're still worth highlighting. For instance:

<a href='http://www.doublethedonation.com/Database/CorpEdit.php?ID=204'>State Street offers three types of employee giving programs.</a> Through the company's CollectMore program, State Street matches the fundraising efforts of employees up to $1,000 annually. 

Similar programs are offered by <a href='http://www.doublethedonation.com/Database/CorporateSearchDetails.php?ID=468'>McAfee</a>, <a href='http://www.doublethedonation.com/Database/CorporateSearchDetails.php?ID=464'>Intuit</a>, and many other companies.

Hope the above is informative!

While I haven't reviewed all of the companies in your comment, <a href='http://www.doublethedonation.com/Database/CorporateSearchDetails.php?ID=36'>HP</a> jumped out at me. The company has two different matching options. You're right that there's a technology match with a generous limit, but there's also a cash match, though the limit is lower. 

At <a href='http://www.doublethedonation.com'>Double the Donation</a>, we help nonprofits raise awareness around matching gift programs and make it easy for their donors to access this information. Our team is regularly updating company info such as match limits, eligibility, guidelines, links, etc. and it's pretty common to see variations in programs such as HP's.

This point is easy to neglect. It’s all very well working for an incredibly high impact cause, but if you do a rubbish job you won’t make much difference (at worst [you might actually do harm](http://80000hours.org/blog/89-why-attractive-people-are-dangerous)). 

Judging your chances of success is hard. You probably don’t want to think of yourself as “merely average”. But **looking at the average person’s chances is the best place to start** if you want to get a realistic picture of how likely you are to succeed.

##The representativeness heuristic

If you’ve ever travelled on the same train or bus route at the same time every morning, you’ll have found you end up seeing the same people every day. When I commuted to work in London from my home in Cambridge over the summer I found myself making up stories about these people to pass the time: imagining what jobs they did and what their lives were like.[^1] This could get pretty dull, as most of the people in my carriage were middle-aged men; smartly dressed and carrying briefcases, tapping on their smart phones. Bankers, businessmen: boring.

There was one man in particular, though, whose story was different. At first glance, he looked like the rest of them. What sparked my interest was that he *read*: and not from a Kindle, but from *books* (shock horror): all with pretty interesting and intellectual-sounding titles. There were some other subtleties: he seemed kinder than the majority of commuters, willing to give up his seat more often, he seemed to take more personal calls, and smiled more. He couldn’t be a cold-hearted businessman.[^2] I imagined that he instead he worked for a charity or nonprofit, the smart dress being explained by his being in a high up position in one of the more well-established such organisations. This seemed much more likely to me than him just being another businessman.

So imagine my surprise when I was passing through Canary Wharf one evening and I saw this man leaving work from one of the big investment banks. It turned out he was a banker after all. How could I have got it so wrong? He just didn’t *seem* like the type.

What I’d neglected to consider here, I realised, was just how many suit-wearing investment bankers there are in London compared to CEOs of major charities. Even though this man didn’t *seem* like a banker, he was still pretty likely to be one: simply because the chances of *any* suited man commuting to London from Cambridge working in the city are high. By contrast, there are very few high-up positions in big charities, so the chances of any random person holding one of them are very slim, regardless of how altruistic they appear.

##Neglecting base rates

It turns out I was making a pretty common mistake called [the base rate fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy). It’s something we often fall prey to when trying to intuitively judge probabilities. Given a description of a person and asked what job we think they do, most people base their judgement on how well the person fits a certain stereotype (known as the [representativeness heuristic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representativeness_heuristic)) rather than thinking how many people there are in each job overall (the *base rate*.) Even when people are explicitly given base rate information, they often ignore it. This is a well-established bias on which a fair amount of literature has been written.[^3] 

This has some serious implications for career choice. If you’re a bright, hardworking and motivated young law student, you might judge your chances of making partner in a big firm as pretty high. You’re exactly the sort of person who would end up making partners, after all.[^4] 70% doesn’t sound completely unreasonable. The problem is that most other law students share these characteristics. And if only one in ten law students eventually make partner in a big law firm (which doesn’t seem unrealistic - in fact, it might be much less, as many won’t even get hired by a big law firm to start with[^5]) then it looks like your judgement is hugely over-optimistic. 

[We often have a tendency to think of ourselves as better than average](http://80000hours.org/blog/124-do-you-think-you-re-better-than-average). Combined with a tendency to ignore base rates, this means we’re likely to overestimate our chances of success in certain careers. If you want to get a realistic picture of your chances of success, better to start with what normally happens: what the average person’s chances are in your situation. You need to know your odds in order to work out where they are highest. This might sound trivial, but it’s really important and easily neglected.

One way to try to avoid this common error is to think in frequencies rather than probabilities. There's evidence that people are less likely to neglect base rates when phrased in the form "x number of people out of the total population satisfy y", than when phrased "the probability of satisfying y is z." So it might be better to think about *how many people are successful* in a given field, than thinking in terms of probabilities of success.[^6]

The general point to take away here is that **when trying to decide which job to do to have more impact, it’s important to think not only about what causes you are personally well suited to, but also which causes have the highest chance of success regardless of who works on them**. You’re probably not going to cure cancer, however well-suited to the task you might *seem*: simply because the chances of anyone doing so are so low. 

However, this doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to factor in our own skills and talents at all when judging our chances of success. Whilst we don’t want to overestimate our chances, we don’t want to underestimate them either. We’ll be writing more about this soon.

[^4]: The reasoning here seems to go something like: “Most partners in top law firms were bright, hardworking and motivated as law students, I am a bright, hardworking, motivated law student, therefore I have a good chance of making partner in a top law firm.” Putting it like this helps clarify what’s going wrong: this is a slight tweak on reasoning of the form “All A’s are B, I am B, therefore I am A” which is clearly flawed.
A related fallacy is confusing necessary and sufficient conditions for success. Being a bright, hardworking, motivated law student may be a *necessary* condition for making partner, but this doesn’t mean it’s a *sufficient* one.

We recently interviewed Roland Mathiasson, vice president of the [Copenhagen Consensus Center](http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com) (CCC), a leading global think tank which draws together over 100 top economists to work on prioritizing the solutions to the most pressing global issues. The Center’s leader, [Dr. Bjorn Lomborg](http://www.lomborg.com), was named one of the world’s 100 most influential people by Time magazine and has been repeatedly named one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers by *Foreign Policy*. We initiated the interview after being contacted by Roland about a job opportunity with CCC.

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/200/original/CCC.jpg?1373908846'><img alt="copenhagen consensus" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/200/large/CCC.jpg?1373908846" /></a>

##Summary of the job opportunity

CCC is looking to hire a Project Manager to focus on organizing the promotion of their research following the setting of the new Millenium Development Goals (MDG).


**We expect this role is high impact career opportunity, albeit with fairly high uncertainty, because**:
* We think prioritisation is likely to be a highly effective cause (see our upcoming research)
* The CCC is one of the only organisations carrying out and promoting prioritisation, and although we don't fully agree with their research, we think they play a valuable role, as well as offering significant potential to have even more impact
* The particular project you would focus on, promoting CCC’s research after the new MDG goals, is promising. Giving What We Can thinks that it may represent a [promising, if speculative, funding opportunity](http://givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-06-14/the-copenhagen-consensus-making-a-bet-on-catching-a-big-fish).
* There seems to be substantial scope for an effective person to have outsized impact compared to the next best candidate


In addition, **the career offers strong good potential to build career capital**, particularly within the prioritisation cause and development policy.
* You would be one member of a team of about six. The CCC collaborates with a network of 100+ economists and promotes this research at the top level of policy using a large network of contractors. You could personally play a major role in leveraging this network to potentially influence huge flows of development assistance.
* You would have the opportunity to interact with journalists, policy makers, top foundations and leading economists
* You could build highly useful transferable skills in project management and communications.


**The ideal candidate**:
* Understands, can communicate and is passionate about the mission of promoting global prioritisation based on data and economic research
* Can be very independent in carrying out their goals
* Can coordinate a large project involving tens of people
* Can cope and enjoy working in a demanding professional organization
* Has strong communication skills
* Is able to deal with numbers and quantitative analysis (but a strong quantitative background is not needed)
* Is fluent in English and computer literate

We think this opportunity would be particularly good for someone who wanted to start a career within the prioritisation cause, especially if more attracted to management or outreach rather than research.

The role can either be based in Budapest or sharing offices with CEA (including 80,000 Hours) and the Future of Humanity Institute in Oxford (in which case you can travel regularly to Budapest). The salary will be in the range of £1500-£2500 per month. The candidate should already be in a position to work inside the EU. The candidate can ideally start as soon as possible and will initially work for 9 months.


##Summary of our other findings 

This interview, along with [our interview with GiveWell](http://80000hours.org/blog/173-looking-for-a-seriously-high-impact-job-using-your-analytical-skills) and our [conversations](http://80000hours.org/blog/152-bringing-it-all-together-high-impact-research-management) with the [Future of Humanity Institute](http://80000hours.org/blog/234-the-future-of-humanity-institute-is-hiring-a-high-impact-project-manager) is part of a broader survey of the prioritisation cause. We don’t yet have any firm conclusions, but are beginning to form the impression that the organisations within the cause are significantly under-supplied with people who have both the right skills (an unusual ability to interpret and apply academic research, as well as the key transferable skills like leadership) and dedication to the cause.

##Overview of post

##Excerpts from the interview

*Note that the indented paragraphs in quotes are quotes from Roland. Other text is my commentary or questions.*

###What does the CCC do?

**Ben: What sort of work does CCC do?**
>“We show philanthropists and governments where you can do the most good in the word -- where you get the biggest bang for the buck. We offer smart economic reasoning from some of the world’s top economists, so you can base your decisions on effectiveness rather than what’s most fashionable, what looks the scariest or which campaigns have the best PR.”

**Ben: How do you do this?**
>“We work with some of the top academics the sharpest minds in the world, to research solutions to major global challenges. What we want to do with it is provide assessment of all the costs and benefits from pursuing or implementing these solutions to decision makers, philanthropists and aid organizations. The main thing is that we are advocating prioritization. We want everyone who wants to do good to realize that  resources are  limited, you can’t do everything. You need to take a stand and begin helping with the things that actually get the biggest bang for the buck.”

**Ben: How large is the team, and what are the key positions?**
>“Bjorn Lomborg is the ideas guy, communicator, and head academic. I’m the organizer and operating officer. We have two directors of communications: one US based and one Europe based. We have a project assistant, and we have an executive assistant to Bjorn who is very key. We’re looking to hire one or two project managers. Whoever we hire will play a significant role in the overall organization.”

**Ben: How quickly are you growing?**
>“We actually don’t want to have too large a team. Instead, we develop the concept for a project internally and contract out all the different parts we need where we can get the best people at the best rates. That’s why these project manager roles are so exciting. It’s a way to utilize global talent for everything. We have a network of contractors and volunteers in France, Germany, the US, Italy, India, Denmark, etc. who help out to larger and lesser extents with communicating in local markets. We also have a network of writers who help out with ghostwriting and editing. We have over 100 economists, and we’re working with media production contractors. There are a lot of people loosely attached to the organization, which enables us to scale really quickly.”

**Ben: In addition to the post-MDG project, what else are you working on?**
>“We’re working more to set priorities in specific areas, like we did with smart investments to end HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. We are doing that now with the American Prosperity Consensus, where we look at the developed world. What are the smart investments you can make today that will ensure a prosperous society in a generation’s time? Is it about investing in broadband or other infrastructure like high-speed rail, or do we need more resources in education? Like would America benefit from compulsory preschool? What is the evidence for these kinds of investment? Usually in the political debate, you don’t discuss the long-term effects of things because politicians needs to be reelected, the US House of Representatives are elected every second year.”


##Why might the CCC be high impact?

A good overview, focused on this post-MDGs promotion project, is provided by Giving What We Can [here](http://givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-06-14/the-copenhagen-consensus-making-a-bet-on-catching-a-big-fish).

In summary:
* Although we don’t wholly endorse all of their research findings, we believe CCC fills a valuable, neglected research niche within the prioritisation cause. It takes the views of top economists on the solutions to the most pressing global problems, and aggregates them with a common framework, into reports that policy makers can understand.
* There is reasonable evidence CCC has effectively promoted this research in the past. For instance, CCC is cited by several key policy agreements and its research gets wide coverage.
* It seems that CCC has a reasonable chance of positively influencing future development assistance spending. Since these flows of money are very large, this offers a large expected pay-off compared to the costs. The costs are only several million dollars per year and a team of six.


**Ben: Why isn’t someone else doing what the CCC does?**


>”Most academic research focuses on just one topic, often even a subsidiary issue within that area. CCC ask the researchers to get back to the top level, talking about what matters across the world, across a lot of different topics from hunger, to climate, to diseases. This is hard -- which is why it is so rare -- but also crucially necessary."

>"Second, most media focuses on simple scary stories or images with cute animals. Stories focus on single-issues like ‘this solution will cost a lot’ or ‘the problem here is immense’. There is a crucial need to integrate both costs and benefits, and across all relevant issue areas. But again, that is hard, which is why it happens so rarely. CCC provides both an academic and an outreach platform for this."

>"Third, most agencies are wary of prioritization: in principle, of course, everyone say it is a good idea, but true prioritization also leads to saying what we shouldn’t do first. And that means some parts of the organization losing their existence."

Some of these reasons are discouraging. If prioritization is hard and unpopular, then CCC may not be able to make much progress.

Other reasons are more encouraging. Academics are incentivised to work on narrow issues in-depth. This means there’s a large body of research that isn’t brought together and applied to prioritise global problems. CCC can fill this gap. Politicians and agencies also find it difficult to carry out or promote prioritisation because it’s politically unpopular. As a relatively independent body, CCC is in a better position to fill this gap.

CCC also has several comparative advantages in this field. First, Bjorn Lomborg has a strong public platform. Second, they’ve already built large economies of scale, most importantly their relationships with top economists.

We also believe that prioritisation is neglected in general, as we'll explain in upcoming research.



##Why is there an opportunity for you to have an outsized impact within this role?

**Ben: What will the job involve?**
>“The post-MDG project will kick off in September, after the summer break. On the administrative side, we need project plans and charts, mainly because there are so many people involved in this project. There will be perhaps 50 economics professors involved, so just to get a hold of them is quite a project. You need to give and adapt instructions for each one of them. Once they have written their draft papers, this person will read and then discuss all these papers with the rest of the team, with Lomborg, with me, and then also get back to each of the academics with suggestions for what they might need to elaborate on or improve. Then this person will also need to co-ordinate rounds of peer reviewing from other economics professors. Once all the research is in place, a very large part of this project will be about communicating the academic results to different stakeholders. That will involve the general public, both in the developing world and in the developed world. I’m not suggesting that this person will be writing the magazine articles or making the short videos by himself or herself, but he will be a key player in that process. Another part of it will be actually facilitating seminars or workshops with UN people, with politicians, and with national aid agencies. And of course there will also be a lot of reading and writing – reading the research papers and giving feedback and then writing up scripts, taking out the essentials of the research papers so they can be made into presentations, web pages, magazine articles, press releases. This person will not do all of this entirely on his own. There are a lot of people helping out, but he or she should be the facilitator or driver to make sure that all of it happens.”

Our impression is that this role offers a significant opportunity for an excellent candidate to add value. This is because the possible outcomes can potentially vary a huge amount in impact. Part of the role involves improving the promotion of prioritisation and carrying out outreach. This is somewhat similar to a sales role, in which [the best people are very much better](http://80000hours.org/blog/69-how-good-are-the-best) than the average. A slight difference in candidates, therefore, could significantly influence the outcomes of the outreach. Since this outreach is very important, that could result in a large impact.

Another way an excellent candidate could have outsized impact is by [freeing up the time](http://80000hours.org/blog/54-the-high-impact-pa-how-anyone-can-bring-about-ground-breaking-research) of the other, more experienced staff, including Bjorn Lomborg. First, being more competent than average would mean that you would require less management time, and could take on more work. Second, since the team is small and flexible, an excellent candidate can quickly take on responsibility and some of the high value tasks the existing time-constrained staff are currently doing. 

>”Ben: We have a really valuable resource in Bjorn Lomborg, because he can get our message out to a wide audience. We can get him on CNN or BBC. And he’s a very skilled communicator. But obviously there’s only 24 hours a day. So if we can add people who can free up Bjorn’s time, they are extremely valuable.”

In addition, we expect this role to be relatively under-supplied with good candidates. First, relatively few people are passionate about prioritisation, reducing the level of skill compared to the salary. Some evidence for this is that CCC was keen to reach the members of 80,000 Hours and find more people who “get the mission.”

Second, there [is evidence](http://givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-06-14/the-copenhagen-consensus-making-a-bet-on-catching-a-big-fish) CCC is moderately under-funded, perhaps reducing wages, so attracting fewer candidates.

Third, our speculative impression is that the skills required are in shortage everywhere - the ability to follow through on projects, strong communications skills, a quantitative mindset and the ability to work independently.

We tried to put a rough figure on the benefit of a good candidate by asking:

**Ben: Would you prefer a good employee tomorrow or £100,000?**

> “I’d prefer the person. If you were talking about more like £1,000,000, we’d take the money, then it could free up Bjorn’s time on fundraising, which could allow him to speak to more policy makers.”

If this is true, then it suggests that a good candidate is several times more valuable than an average one. Further, it would be hard outweigh your added value through [Earning to Give](/earning-to-give), since it would be hard to donate these amounts (though note that Earning to Give is more flexible, which is [a significant advantage](http://80000hours.org/blog/233-how-important-is-keeping-your-options-open)).


##What’s the potential to build career capital?

**Ben: What sort of future opportunities will the job provide?**
>“If the candidate turns out to be really successful, we are doing projects on a regular basis, and to be honest, if he or she is really good, it could easily become a permanent position, even if we don’t know what the next project is right now. There is also cost for the organization to find new project managers, so we would rather have a permanent one. What this person will learn and take with him or her is basic project management skills and, to be more specific, really being able to utilize a network organization which is really in demand because more and more organizations are going virtual, contracting out and are increasingly international. Then, of course, this person will build his own network. They will interact with researchers, media people and also the decision-makers that we are trying to influence.”

##Who would suit this role?

**Ben: What sort of person is CCC looking for?**
>“We need someone who can move things forward. It’s a person who is not afraid of taking on responsibility and a person who takes initiative. In general, I think the very most important thing is actually that the person follows through, delivers what they promise to deliver. We need someone who helps us achieving the goals that we already set and that believes in what we are trying to accomplish. We’re kind of impatient. We don’t want to spend time explaining basic things. This is one of the personality traits we assess: that you’re really interested in and passionate about what we’re doing. You can be passionate about policy, or passionate about numbers, or passionate about economics, or politics. ”

**Ben: What kinds of concrete achievements would be good evidence of being a strong candidate. For instance, would you prefer someone who had founded their own small non-profit or had a very strong academic record?**

> “Definitely either of these would demonstrate it. If I were choosing between the two, then I would go for the one with the excellent academic record. If you set up your own NGO, then you’re probably too independent to be team player. Or to be honest then your time is probably more valuable. We need someone who helps us achieving the goals that we already set.”

> “If you’ve been a youth politician that can be great; we’ve had a very good experience with those.”

**Ben: What are the qualifications an applicant will need?**
>“You need close to native English skills, both written and spoken. There will be a lot of writing up reports and collaborating with our network of economists who are 80 or 85% US based. One vital part of all of our projects are about communications with economists and journalists. You need writing skills, you probably also will help design / layout the reports and websites you work on, and you need to be able to communicate clearly in English. Then also computer literacy. We do want them to be a bit quantitative or to have an economics degree. It’s not a requirement, but you can’t be afraid of numbers and models. Some people are very qualitative in their thinking, and they won’t be successful working with academics in economics. We look for personality fit with the team and really being self-motivated. Since we’re a network organization, you need to be able to work on your own.”

###How can I apply?

**Ben: What is the application process like?**
>“My colleague reads through the CV and the personal letter to get a sense of who has the qualifications, then she sets up a 15-minute call with all who have the right qualifications, where she asks standardized questions to assess their level of English but also to get a sense of their motivation. Half of the candidates are usually sorted out because they don’t have the qualifications, then we do a really simple personality test – an online thing that only takes ten minutes – which is a very good talking point when we then meet the candidate. Then we also have them do a very simple computer skills test, which is also online. If you fail that test, then you have an issue with computer skills, and to be honest, some candidates do. The candidates that are interesting then submit a writing sample to check three things: if they get back to us in time, if their language is advanced or professional enough, and some qualitative assessment of what they chose to send us. The last thing is the personal interview where we try to see if they like us and we like them. That’s obviously very qualitative, so it’s really hard.”

In 1900 the mathematician David Hilbert published a list of 23 of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics.  This list heavily influenced mathematical research over the 20th century: if you worked on one of Hilbert’s problems, then you were doing respectable mathematics.

There is no such list within moral philosophy.  That’s a shame.  Not all problems that are discussed in ethics are equally important.  And often early graduate students have no idea what to write their thesis on – and so just pick something they’ve written on for coursework previously, or pick something that’s ‘hot’ at the time.  I don’t know for sure, but I imagine the same is true of many other academic disciplines.

What would the equivalent list look like for moral philosophy?  Of course, it’s difficult to define ‘important’, but let’s say here that they are the potentially soluble problems that, if solved and taken seriously, would make the greatest difference to the way the world is currently run.  I’ve briefly discussed this idea with Nick Beckstead, and also Carl Shulman and Nick Bostrom, and here’s a select list of what we came up with.  For more explanation of why, see my previous two posts on high impact philosophy, [here](http://80000hours.org/blog/46-how-to-be-a-high-impact-philosopher) and [here](http://80000hours.org/blog/98-how-to-be-a-high-impact-philosopher-part-ii).

###The Practical List

<br>

1. **What’s the optimal career choice?** [Earning to give](/earning-to-give), [advocacy](/advocacy), [research](/research) and [innovation](/innovation), or something more common-sensically virtuous?

2.	**What’s the optimal [donation area](/donating)?** Development charities?  Animal welfare charities?  Extinction risk mitigation charities? Meta-charities? Or [investing the money and donating later](/career-strategy)?

3.	**What are the highest leverage political policies?** Libertarian paternalism? Prediction markets?  Cruelty taxes, such as taxes on caged hens; luxury taxes?

4.	**What are the highest value areas of [research](/high-impact-research)?** Tropical medicine?  Artificial intelligence?  Economic cost-effectiveness analysis? Moral philosophy?

5.	**Given our best ethical theories (or best credence distribution in ethical theories), what’s the biggest problem we currently face?**

<br>

###The Theoretical List

<br>


1.	**What’s the correct population ethics?** How should we value future people compared with present people?  Do people have diminishing marginal value?

2.	**Should we maximise expected value when it comes to small probabilities of huge amounts of value?** If not, what should we do instead?

3.	**How should we respond to the possibility of creating infinite value (or disvalue)?** Should that consideration swamp all others?  If not, why not?

4.	**How should we respond to the possibility that the universe actually has infinite value?** Does it mean that we have no reason to do any action (because we don’t increase the sum total of value in the world)?  Or does this possibility refute aggregative consequentialism?

5.	**How should we accommodate moral uncertainty?** Should we apply expected utility theory?  If so, how do we make intertheoretic value comparisons?  Does this mean that some high-stakes theories should dominate our moral thinking, even if we assign them low credence?

6.	**How should intuitions weigh against theoretical virtues in normative ethics?** Is common-sense ethics roughly correct?  Or should we prefer simpler moral theories?

7.	**Should we prioritise the prevention of human wrongs over the alleviation of naturally caused suffering?** If so, by how much?

8.	**What sorts of entities have moral value?** Humans, presumably.  But what about non-human animals? Insects?  The natural environment? Artificial intelligence? 

9.	**What additional items should be on these lists?**

Thanks for the comments!  Responding just to some.

Carl: thanks for letting me know about the LW discussion - I hadn't seen that.  In terms of the list being consequentialist in its assumptions - actually, I don't think that's true.  It's perfectly compatible with thinking that people have both rights - things you may not do to people even though it would be better, impartially considered, if you did them - and options - things that it's permissible to do, even though they aren't the best options, impartially considered, available to you.  You can think that X is more important than Y even if you think that it would be impermissible to violate someone's rights in order to achieve X over Y.  And you can think that X is more important than Y even if you think that it would be permissible to choose either X or Y if nothing else was at stake.  How 'important' solving a question is is an evaluative question - like saying "how good would it be to solve it?".  But it's not only consequentialists that are interested in evaluative questions.

What would be typically non-consequentialist (or non-utilitarian) issues that arise on these lists?  Whether equality is of value?  But almost all views agree in practice that equality is of value - they just disagree on why that's so (whether it's valuable in and of itself, or merely for instrumental reasons).  Whether there are side-constrants on action?  But again, almost all views agree in practice that you shouldn't go around killing people, or stealing - they just disagree on why that's so.  The question Adriano mentions: "should the numbers count?" is a good one which could plausibly be added - perhaps I'd state it as "is it even possible to aggregate wellbeing?".  If it weren't, that would have pretty radical consequences - and there are quite a lot of non-consequentialist philosophers who are at least somewhat sympathetic to that idea.

Over on LW, Daniel Burfoot suggests: "Is it ethical to pay taxes?  Is it ethical to send your children to school?  Is it ethical to associate with governments?"  Other commentators suggest that something like "is egoism true?" should be added to the list.  But these aren't really open questions within moral philosophy.  And, even if they were, would failing to know these be catastrophic, in the way that failing to know some of the things I've listed above would be?  If non-human animals and humans have equal moral standing, then factory farming is probably the most horrific  wrong ever caused by man.  But if it's wrong to pay taxes, then is the fact that governments tax people an atrocity of the same scale?  No moral philosopher (not even Nozick, who raises the slavery analogy) would think that.

Finally, you might say that my list is consequentialist because it's concerned with what, if solved taken seriously, would make the greatest difference to the way the world is currently run (rather than say, the solving of which would have the greatest intrinsic value).  But that's how I defined 'importance' before stating the lists.


Michael: it's fair to criticise me for leaving meta-ethics out.  My thought was that the importance of meta-ethics (as I defined importance), was in how it impacts upon normative ethics.  In which case it's highly relevant to (6), though not mentioned there.  


David: I'm actually sympathetic to something similar that you say in (1).  But it's got some really bad problems.  It would be too lengthy a discussion to go into here, but it's discussed in Bostrom's paper (linked to above), in section 4.2 onwards.  Your second suggestion, in the paragraph after (2)  - which I think is quite different from the first - is also discussed in that paper.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1131</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Bastian Stern</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>bastiancstern@googlemail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/bastian-stern</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-06-07 12:22:40</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'd add: "What things are of final value?"

But I can't help myself.

On theoretical question 4 ("How should we respond to the possibility that the universe actually has infinite value?"):

1. We won't ever have certainty that there's an infinite amount of utility/disutility in the universe.  Say someone is wedded to the idea that we should evaluate actions by how they change the aggregate utility in the universe, and wedded to the idea that an in infinite-utility universe, all finite actions have zero change to this utility.  This person could then take an expectation value over the two possibilities (finite universe with non-zero change to aggregate utility; infinite universe with zero change), and conclude that murdering a human should be treated as wrong, regardless of whether the number of aliens is finite or infinite.

2. I only wrote point 1 to show that even accepting some rather bizarre and unnecessary premises, we don't have to conclude that we have no moral reason to do anything.  

My main point is that we can just re-cast any ethical system so that it only applies to the beings affected by your action.  For utilitarianism we'd just add up the utility of the people on Earth (the probability that donating to the Against Malaria Foundation will affect distant aliens by some quantum randomness is tiny, and would be tiny even with a sum over an infinite number of such aliens).

In practical terms, this means that everyone could carry on with their ethical judgements just as before.  That the finiteness or otherwise of the number of aliens is considered to have important consequences for ethics suggests to me that there are problems with academic philosophy.  It is definitely not a "high-impact" question.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>655</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Carl Shulman</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>carl.shulman@post.harvard.edu</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/carl-shulman</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-10-22 22:36:59</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Will, some examples of less consequentialist possibilities:

You glossed over issues of distribution, fairness, and rights as not so important (in consequenialist fashion) today. But the same could be said of population ethics, infinite value, and so forth. At the moment many things are tightly coupled that may become less so in the future, and that we can affect to some degree. If we try to steer the future in one direction or another we may be pushing probability mass between worlds of tremendously different welfare, equality, etc.

The deontology of probabilistic harm is worth mentioning. A great number of actions have some small chance (subjective or objective) of harming people. How does this fact interact with side-constraints? It seems like it may vastly extend the range of situations in which deontology conflicts with utilitarianism.

Prisoner's Dilemmas, bargaining problems, "fair divisions" and so forth are of immense practical importance in politics, international relations, and elsewhere.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>80,000 Hours in the Washington Post! - Our responses to the coverage</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/227-80-000-hours-in-the-washington-post-our-responses-to-the-coverage</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/191/original/media_coverage.jpg?1370611227'><img alt="Media_coverage" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/191/large/media_coverage.jpg?1370611227" /></a>

The concept of [Earning to Give](/earning-to-give) was featured in the Washington Post last week. [The article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/31/join-wall-street-save-the-world/) profiles several people, including some 80,000 Hours members, pursuing Earning to Give, and explains the rationale behind the idea.

In combination with Peter Singer’s TED talk on [effective altruism](http://effective-altruism.com/node/4), which mentions 80,000 Hours, we’ve been receiving very heavy and sustained web traffic - over 10,000 visitors in just two weeks.

The Washington Post article generated a number of high profile responses, including an opinion piece in the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html?ref=davidbrooks&_r=0), a piece in the [National Review](http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/349841/rise-singerians-reihan-salam), and a mention on [Daily Mail Online](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2334682/Young-professionals-joining-Wall-Street-save-world.html) - the world’s most read online newspaper. (Unfortunately they call us 8,000 Hours!)

There was much praise for the idea of Earning to Give and Effective Altruism, as well as the dedication of the people mentioned. Many of the criticisms, including those reflected more generally in the comments, are criticisms or misunderstandings we have addressed many times in the past, for instance in our [FAQ about Earning to Give](http://80000hours.org/faq#faq-what-is-earning-to-give), in this series of [three](http://80000hours.org/blog/35-the-replaceability-effect-working-in-unethical-industries-part-1) [blog](http://80000hours.org/blog/61-collective-action-working-in-unethical-industries-part-2) [posts](http://80000hours.org/blog/64-universalisability-immoral-industries-part-3), and in Will’s [original paper](http://www.academia.edu/1557895/Replaceability_Career_Choice_and_Making_a_Difference). One of the most widespread misunderstandings has been that 80,000 Hours believes Earning to Give is typically the optimal career path; whereas we actually believe that it’s only optimal for a fraction of people, and whether a particular person should Earn to Give is a complex empirical question, which depends on the cause you support and many other factors.

In the rest of this post, I’ll comment on the two most prominent response articles. 

In the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html?ref=davidbrooks&_r=0), David Brooks first raises the corruption objection:

> If there is a large gap between your daily conduct and your core commitment, you will become more like your daily activities and less attached to your original commitment. You will become more hedge fund, less malaria.

Later he says:

>Taking a job just to make money, on the other hand, is probably going to be corrosive, even if you use the money for charity rather than sports cars.

We agree this is a worry, but Brooks doesn’t produce evidence that this worry outweighs the advantages of Earning to Give. The strongest evidence we know in support of the corruption objection is the body of research in psychology which shows that we are strongly influenced by the behaviour of our social group[^1]. This supports the intuitive belief that if you surround yourself with non-altruistic people, you’re likely to become less altruistic yourself. In our experience, however, the people working in finance are not all evil! There are plenty of altruistic people, and if you can pick a firm with enough of them, becoming corrupted may not be a worry. In addition, you can make sure you socialise with other altruistic people in your spare time, and use other commitment devices such as making a [public declaration](/join) of your intention to donate. It’s early days, but it seems that the people who have recently started Earning to Give are not in danger of corruption, and there are [examples](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8550747/Hedge-fund-boss-Chris-Hohn-gives-away-1bn-in-five-years.html) of people who have successfully pursued finance in order to engage in philanthropy. With a bit of work, it seems the corruption worry can be mitigated.

Brooks also warns against becoming overly calculating in your altruism.

>I would worry about turning yourself into a means rather than an end...But a human life is not just a means to produce outcomes, it is an end in itself.  

If a human life is an end in itself, then why should we prioritise our own lives as ends so extremely over those of other people? If Jason Trigg (the person pursuing Earning to Give in the original article) quits his job and stops donating, then hundreds of people will die of malaria in the developing world. If human lives are important ends in themselves, then this is a terrible outcome.

>I’d think you would be more likely to cultivate a deep soul if you put yourself in the middle of the things that engaged you most seriously.  If your profoundest interest is dying children in Africa or Bangladesh, it’s probably best to go to Africa or Bangladesh, not to Wall Street.

Is it more important for Jason Trigg to “cultivate a deep soul” than save hundreds of lives? And is it even obvious that Trigg isn’t cultivating a deep soul? He’s willing to strive hard to make the world a better place, standing up to conventional wisdom and sacrificing luxuries he could easily obtain. He thinks hard about how to use his talents to make a contribution. In our experience, putting yourself on this path attracts allies, meaningful relationships united by altruism and a deep sense of purpose.

>You might end up enlarging the faculties we use to perceive the far — rationality — and eclipsing the faculties we use to interact with those closest around — affection, the capacity for vulnerability and dependence.

Effective Altruism arose because it seems that people’s widely held goals to be altruistic were being frustrated by a lack of rationality - a lack that’s reflected in Brooks’ article. If we start with our affection for those closest around us and recognize rationally that every human life counts equally, we arrive at the conclusion that the near and the far are equally important and equally deserving of our concern. Effective Altruism is a combination of affection and rationality.

Reihan Salam’s [piece in the National Review](http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/349841/rise-singerians-reihan-salam) reads a political angle into our agenda which doesn’t exist.

He includes an extensive quote of Julian Sanchez:

>If the world is primarily made better through private action, then the most morally praiseworthy course available to a highly intelligent person of moderate material tastes might be to pursue a far less inherently interesting career in business or finance, live a middle-class lifestyle, and devote one’s wealth to various good causes. In this scenario, after all, the intellectual who could make millions for charity as a financier or high-powered attorney, but prefers to take his compensation in the form of leisure time and interesting work, is not obviously morally better than the actual financier or attorney who uses his monetary compensation to purchase material pleasures. Both are declining to sacrifice personal satisfaction in order to help others—one has just chosen a form of compensation that can’t be taxed and redistributed easily. If private efforts are ineffectual or relatively unimportant compared with political action, however, the intellectual can rest assured that he’s satisfying his moral obligations by paying taxes and writing persuasively in support of the appropriate political remedies.

Salam identifies Trigg’s Earning to Give approach with a conservative political position, which holds that private action is generally more important than political action.

>The individuals Dylan describes seem to believe that private action can do a great deal of good — for example, giving directly to poor people in the developing world might in some be preferable to government-to-government transfers, also known as overseas development assistance.

This misunderstanding is one reason that 80,000 Hours can [wind up those with strongly progressive political views.](http://oxfordleftreview.com/2012/07/05/olr-issue/)

It’s true that Effective Altruists believe private action can do a great deal of good, but they are also in favor of political solutions. Effective Altruists are concerned with how they can make the most positive impact on the basis of evidence, through whatever means. Almost everyone we know pursuing Earning to Give would gladly welcome effective government-to-government transfers aimed at reducing poverty, just as they would welcome equally effective private transfers.

At the end of his article, Salam points out:

>amassers of great wealth who build useful, scalable technologies can also do a great deal of good even in the absence of any benevolent motivating impulse...it is very possible that people who are solely motivated by curiosity and novelty or a desire for recognition could have a much bigger positive impact than people who devote their lives to social justice.

Our response is that people motivated solely by curiosity will only have a bigger positive impact than those who devote themselves to social justice if those who devote themselves to social justice do it badly. If the evidence suggests that being involved in private entrepreneurship on average has a greater positive impact than being more directly involved in social justice, then we will recommended that members of 80,000 Hours get involved in entrepreneurship. 

The relative benefit of being involved in entrepreneurship and donating to an effective charity is currently unclear to us, though we suspect donations are typically more important. We’ll be writing more about this topic soon.

#Why work for 80,000 Hours?

*Quick disclaimer: I’ve been working for 80,000 Hours since last October. The below is a summary of all the reasons I’ve found working here awesome, and why I think others would too.*

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/202/original/WholeTeam1.jpg?1374519929'><img alt="Wholeteam1" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/202/large/WholeTeam1.jpg?1374519929" /></a>
*The 80,000 Hours core team*

***

First and foremost, **“making the world a better place” is our bottom line and central aim.** If you work for 80,000 Hours, you can directly help hundreds of other people have more impact with their careers. We work on this project because we think it’s the best way for us to make a contribution. Developing ways to monitor our own impact is one of our biggest priorities. 

But there’s more:

**Be part of something incredibly exciting**

We want to completely change the way people think about their careers, which we find to be an unbelievably exciting and motivating project.

**Do work that’s important, challenging and varied**

[Everyone wants a job they love](http://80000hours.org/blog/134-our-research-on-how-to-find-a-job-you-love), as well as one that makes a difference. Job satisfaction seems to come from work that's [challenging, makes a contribution, and has variety](http://80000hours.org/blog/68-how-to-find-a-job-you-ll-love). We find that working on the question of how people can make the most impact with their careers involves seriously interesting work. What's more, we actively seek to design our roles to max out on these factors.

**Work with incredible people**

Everyone who works for us is talented, dedicated and ambitious. When I asked people in the office for what they most liked about working here, “great people” came up the most - see our [recruitment page](http://80000hours.org/recruitment) for some testimonials.

**Meet incredible people**

We work closely with academics at the University of Oxford: we share offices with the [Future of Humanity Institute](http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/) and are affiliated with the [Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics](http://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/), based in the same building. Our careers coaching program is attracting some of the most inspiring and interesting people in the world: we’re currently getting so many requests we have to turn away 80% of them. 

**Become the most impressive person you can**

Helping you to fulfil your potential to make a huge difference is one of the most important things we can do, so we make personal development a priority. We’ll tailor your work so you can develop the skills you want, as well as explicitly setting aside time each week to work on personal development and self improvement.

**Find exciting future job opportunities**

One of our interns last year spun off the organisation Effective Animal Activism with our help, which has now raised $60,000 in external funding, and we helped another intern to get a Marshall scholarship to study at Oxford. We’re growing an amazing network of people and organisations working on the highest impact opportunities in the world - we’re in contact with some pretty impressive individuals like [Nick Bostrom of FHI](http://80000hours.org/blog/140-how-to-make-a-difference-in-research-an-interview-with-nick-bostrom) and [Holden Karnofsky of GiveWell](http://80000hours.org/blog/172-interview-with-holden-karnofsky-co-founder-of-givewell).

**Live in Oxford**

Oxford is a fun, beautiful university town. There's lots of interesting people to meet, culture, parks, meadows and beautiful buildings. You'll rarely need to cycle more than 15 minutes to get anywhere.
 
If you work for us, you’ll also have:

**Autonomy**

We have a “professional, but autonomous” work culture.  We set high standards, but avoid pointless rules. For example, we encourage our employees to set a work routine that works for them and stick to it, but have no strict office hours.

**Responsibility**

As we’re a new and growing organisation, there’s a lot of opportunity to take on responsibility much earlier than you would in a large corporation. Many of our interns develop management experience by working with volunteers.

**Input**

We want everyone to have a say in how 80,000 Hours is run. We hold weekly team meetings to give everyone an input, and also run weekly lunchtime sessions on some specific area of what we’re working on to get input and feedback.

**It’s also just a ton of fun!** The team is very sociable and we do lots of things together besides work: team dinners and weekly Friday pub trips, movie nights, and much more.

*"Which cause is best?" debate at the recent Centre for Effective Altruism away weekend.*

Finally, **there’s no better place to try and figure out your own career path**. I can’t emphasise this one enough - it’s something I’ve found ridiculously valuable. One of the best ways to figure out the answers to your questions is to discuss them with other people who are thinking about the same issues. You’ll be in an environment surrounded by other people who are ambitious about making a difference with the careers, giving you ample opportunity to do this. We give each other constant feedback and advice on future career plans, and also offer formal careers advice to everyone who works with us.

Follow-up to: [Salary or startup? How do-gooders can gain more from risky careers](http://80000hours.org/blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers)

In a previous [post](http://80000hours.org/blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers), I discussed how high-risk, high-reward careers can be a better deal for those who want to do good: if you strike it rich, buying a tenth car will add very little to your personal quality of life, but vaccinating a tenth child will help that child about as much as the first one.  This matters in practice: most venture-backed startups fail, but the average (mean) financial gain to founders is measured in millions.

However, it would be a mistake to think of the returns to entrepreneurship as predictably stemming from just showing up and taking a spin at the wheel of startup roulette.  Instead, entrepreneurship is more like poker: a game where even the best players cannot predictably win over a single night, but measurable differences predict that some will earn much more than others on average.  By paying attention to predictors of entrepreneurial success (whether good news or bad), you can better tell whether you have a winning hand or should walk away for a different game.  And even if the known predictors don’t bear on your own situation, knowing about these predictors can dispel the “lottery illusion”, and can let you know that success is not magic, and that it is worth investing in skill, hard work, strategy, and an understanding of the game.

Let’s take a look at some of those predictors...

**Does your invention make business sense?**

In Canada, the university of Waterloo is something of an “MIT of the north,” an engineering-intensive school where many students create innovative technologies and sometimes go on to build successful businesses out of them, most famously [Mike Lazaridis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lazaridis) the creator of the BlackBerry.  To help would-be inventors from Waterloo and elsewhere, the government offers an Innovator’s Assistance Program (IAP) to evaluate innovations and their potential for commercialization (e.g. by patenting and licensing, creating a business to sell the technology, etc).  Since a huge number of innovators have used the program and outcomes of participants are tracked, a number of academic studies have used this dataset, and found that the program did impressively well in predicting inventor success.  This was highlighted in Daniel Kahneman’s recent [book](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/books/review/thinking-fast-and-slow-by-daniel-kahneman-book-review.html?pagewanted=all) “Thinking, Fast and Slow.”

The program assigned numerical scores for a number of categories (market demand, existing competition, difficulty of manufacturing, etc) and combined them to form letter grades from A to E.  In a sample of over a thousand inventions, the 2% of inventions with the highest grade were commercialized more than half the time, while the 15% with the lowest grade were never commercialized. Inventions with B and C grades were commercialized about four times as often as D grade inventions (a majority of the total), and 2.7 times as often considering only inventors who continued work after learning their grade.

Aside from the surprisingly high predictive power of the test (and the high success rate of "A" grade inventions), one thing that stands out is the overconfidence of those receiving the lowest grades: almost half of those with “E” grades persevere in attempting to commercialize their inventions, even though every single one fails.  Kahnemann uses this dataset to highlight unrealistic entrepreneurial optimism, even as it displays the accuracy of the “Critical Factors Assessment” test, a simplified version of which is available for free [online](http://innovationcentre.ca/tools/cfa-snapshot/).  If you can update on negative as well as positive information, you will be [ahead of the game](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/11/cant-hear-bad-news.html).

**Past start-up success predicts future start-up success**

One of the most damning facts about the investment management industry is that, for the vast majority of funds, past returns have almost no correlation with future returns.  In other words, most of the skilled professionals in that industry are doing [no better than chance](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1356021) for their investors, and worse than that after their fees are taken into account.  How does the situation compare for startup entrepreneurs?

One attempt to tackle this question comes from a 2006 [paper](http://businessinnovation.berkeley.edu/WilliamsonSeminar/scharfstein041207.pdf) by Gompers, Kovner, Lerner, and Schwartzstein (2006).  They use data on companies receiving venture capital funding between 1975 and 2000, and contrast entrepreneurs receiving venture capital funding for the first time, with serial entrepreneurs who had received venture investments in previous startups.  They then measure “success” by whether the firm had made an initial public offering by 2003.  Their raw data show that while 25.3% of first-time VC-backed entrepreneurs reach a successful IPO, 29.0% of the serial entrepreneurs do on their second try, and serial entrepreneurs who succeeded the first time are substantially more likely to succeed the second time than serial entrepreneurs who failed first.

When the authors go on to match firms, based on variables such as firm age, they compare the chance of IPO for a firm with typical characteristics on these axes, save for the past experience of the entrepreneur. The chance of IPO 30% with a previously successful (VC-backed) entrepreneur, 20% with one who has previously failed, and 18% with a first-time entrepreneur. The paper also finds that performance differences between experienced and inexperienced venture capitalists are greatest with respect to first-time entrepreneurs and first-time-failed entrepreneurs, but small with respect to entrepreneurs who have previously succeeded, i.e. that expert VCs have some skill in identifying “diamonds in the rough.”  (The fact that it is possible to develop such skill indicates that there are identifiable differences between success-prone and failure-prone startups.)

If those numbers seem low for companies that have already received VC funding, you’re right: they don’t include companies that were acquired rather than conducting an IPO; see the Woodward and Hall paper I discussed in my last [post on entrepreneurship for do-gooders](http://80000hours.org/blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers), for more inclusive numbers (with first-time founding teams exiting with at least $1 million a third of the time).  The authors claim that including acquisitions would give results “qualitatively similar” to the aggregate results, so readers would do well to assume the effect sizes are at least somewhat smaller (given researchers’ tendencies to present data in the most interesting light).

**Tips from the right tail: how smart is Bill Gates?**

Physicist and polymath Steve Hsu [offers](http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2009/11/if-youre-so-smart-why-arent-you-rich.html
) another angle on predictors of entrepreneurial success: look at the very most extreme examples of entrepreneurial success and note their deviations from the norm.  In that post he works his way down the first three slots of the 2009 Forbes magazine list of the world’s richest people, finding Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and Carlos Slim, and considers strong evidence that they are easily in the top 1%, and perhaps much higher:

>Bill Gates scored 1580 on the pre-1995 SAT. His IQ is clearly >> 145 and possibly as high as 160 or so.

>Warren Buffett graduated high school at 16 ranked in the top 5 percent of his class despite devoting substantial effort to entrepreneurial activities. Most people who know him well refer to him as brilliant, that folksy quote above notwithstanding. I would suggest the evidence is strong that his IQ is above 135, perhaps higher than 145.

>Carlos Slim studied engineering and taught linear programming while still an undergraduate at UNAM, the top university in Mexico. He reportedly discovered the use of compound interest at age 10. I would suggest his IQ is also at least 135.

>So it would appear that the three richest men in the world all have IQs that are higher than 90 percent or even 99 percent of the > 120 IQ population. (Relative to the general population they are all likely in the 99th or even 99.9th percentile.) **The probability of this happening in the Igon Model** (on which cognitive ability above the 90th percentile has little impact on entrepreneurial success) **is less than 1 in 1000**; (i.e. intelligence matters, even at the high end.)

Other demographic statistics from Forbes’ various “Richest X” [lists](http://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/) can help shed light on the importance of education, parental success, and other indicators.

**Eyes of the Incubators**

Many venture capitalists invest relatively late in the lifecycle of a startup, after it has proven itself in a number of ways. But tech incubators like [YCombinator](http://ycombinator.com/) and [TechStars](http://www.techstars.com/) invest in numerous very early-stage software/web startups, enough to gain significant expertise, and one that tentatively appears to be confirmed in the [results](http://ycombinator.com/nums.html) of their [investments](http://www.kikabink.com/news/do-startup-seed-funding-programs-really-work/), which seem comparable to those of funds with later investment schedules. The choices of these organizations can give interesting information for prospective altruist entrepreneurs.

This [article](http://www.yalelawtech.org/uncategorized/final-project-so-you-wanna-be-a-founder-get-into-an-accelerator-study-stem/) examines the Linkedin social network profiles of entrepreneurs backed by these incubators to determine the courses they studied and the universities they attended. About 50% studied Computer Science, 14% Engineering, 4% Physics, 3% math, with almost all the remainder taking social science or humanities degrees. Around 27% attended what the authors described as "top schools" in the U.S., meaning members of the Ivy League, Stanford, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. However, this is understates the representation of selective academic programs, since it excludes a number of universities known similarly high-quality student bodies or excellence in computer science, e.g. [Caltech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology), [Swarthmore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarthmore_College) and other top liberal arts colleges, and [Carnegie Mellon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University).

One can also consult the public statements of the incubators, although obviously such statements are biased by the need to conceal business secrets of the selection process, and the desire to encourage entrepreneurs to apply to their programs. For instance, in this [interview](http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2011/05/what-it-takes-to-be-startup-founder.html) Ycombinator founder Paul Graham discusses (in addition to high intelligence and skill as a hacker) determination and aggressiveness. If one arrange a private and frank discussion with such an investor, that will give feedback which is hard to beat for accuracy.

**Value of Information**

Someone considering entrepreneurship as a way to do good has reason to care about the [expected value](http://80000hours.org/blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers) of their income, including the chances of big success.  Taking into account factors like the output of the CFA test for inventors, the results of psychometric tests, past track records, and the (honest) estimates of skilled venture capitalists can multiply or divide the expected value of that course by several fold.  That's reason enough to go out of your way to gather such info, both about yourself and your prospective start-up, when weighing it as a career and as a way to do good.

#Use a task management system
Many of us at 80,000 Hours have found that having a good task management system - a list of tasks with a process for maintaining it - is important for being productive. The most popular sysetm is called Getting Things Done and you can read a summary of it [here](http://www.wikisummaries.org/Getting_Things_Done:_The_Art_of_Stress-Free_Productivity).

##How does it work and what are the benefits?
###Capture
Whenever you get new tasks you make sure to put them in your system. The main benefit here is that you get all your tasks out of your head. This means you feel more relaxed and can concentrate more easily, knowing that you haven’t missed anything. Capturing all your tasks also makes you less likely to miss something important.

###Review and prioritisation
In your regular reviews (especially daily and weekly reviews) you’ll prioritise your work. This is a potentially huge benefit if your prioritisation helps you choose tasks with far more impact than other tasks.

###Motivation through goal-setting
[Good goal setting is highly effective at increasing motivation](http://80000hours.org/blog/164-should-you-plan-your-career) and a good task management system fulfils some of the criteria suggested by goal setting researchers:

* It encourages you to set specific goals
* As you tick things of you feel as if you’re making progress your broader goals.
* It makes you more confident about completing your broader goals because you break them down into specific tasks.

##Is it worth it?
I find the daily review takes about 10 minutes and the weekly review takes about 1 hour, so that’s a weekly cost of 1.5 hours. So you lose about 4% of your work time to this. Good goal setting can increase your productivity about 10%, so that single benefit probably makes it worth it. On top of this, you’ll be less stressed by all the stuff you have to do. And incorporating prioritisation into your task management could lead to very large benefits as you spend more time on the most important tasks. So it seems plausible that a good task management system would improve your productivity by much more than 4%.

###The dangers of mis-prioritisation:
Task management systems can sometimes lead to people being really efficient at doing small admin tasks, but a) not doing things that matter or b) not [doing things that take a lot of hard concentration and cannot be easily broken down into smaller parts](http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/12/21/getting-unremarkable-things-done-the-problem-with-david-allens-universalism/).

The answer to this then is to
* Build prioritisation into your reviews
* Set aside blocks of time for focussed work on problems that are hard to break down into smaller tasks.

##How strong is the evidence?
Firstly, the system makes sense - it feels more like systematised common sense than anything too radical.

But there is also scientific evidence that supports some of the components of task management.

Finally, the Getting Things Done system is very popular. Although lots of popular things are useless, this suggests that many people find it helpful. Several people in the 80,000 Hours have adopted it and found it to boost their productivity.

##Our recommendation
* Read a [summary of Getting Things Done](http://www.wikisummaries.org/Getting_Things_Done:_The_Art_of_Stress-Free_Productivity) and set up the system, either all at once or bit-by-bit. This [Getting Things Done FAQ](http://zenhabits.net/the-getting-things-done-gtd-faq/) has tips on how to get started.
* Use a commitment device to get going - it can feel like a big hassle at the beginning so it’s helpful to aid your motivation.
* Make sure that you set aside time for working on large tasks with ambiguous next steps.

Good software options for task management are:
If you're on apple, use [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/) ($50)

If you're on windows/android, use [Remember the milk.](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/) (free)

If you want to share tasks with a team, use [Asana.](http://asana.com) (free)

If you want a more minimal solution, use [TaskPaper](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper) (Apple only, free).

It’s worth spending some time deciding between these, as you’ll be using your system every day.

On focus boosting: I'm a big fan of the Pomodoro technique (www.pomodorotechnique.com). The basic idea is to take regular, short breaks in between fairly short, timed working sessions (25 minutes on, 5 minutes off). In my experience, its very well suited to tasks like programming and writing emails... the short bursts introduce a sense of urgency to your working sessions, while the regular breaks let your mind recharge. Officially, you're supposed to time the breaks, but I find its better not to, because its hard to properly relax when there's a clock counting down. Sometimes my short break becomes a 15 minute one, but overall I think it still works out very well - I just go with however long it takes to get my mind back to feeling fresh....]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1046</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Gregory Lewis</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>gjlewis37@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/gregory-lewis</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-05-06 16:21:25</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Richard,

I'm keen and grateful for this series, and think the issues are very important, but I'm a highly sceptical about productivity/task management systems, and I'm not persuaded by this post. I was hoping you can show me my mistakes.

If (say) there were 10% or so productivity gains to be made by using particular task management systems, we'd expect to see them dominate in situations where being highly productive is rewarded (which is most of them): the 110%ers have a huge competitive advantage in terms of working, getting good grades, doing lots of stuff, etc. Yet looking around my highly achieving peers, I don't see any sort of trend where the most successful have particular methods of organising themselves - i.e. those who use GTD or similar don't seem to manage better than those who don't. Although I know much less about other high achieving groups (Execs, Nobellists, etc.), I'm unaware of any big trend between task management technique and success.

There is a (mild) trend where the *most* organized tend to do the best, but this isn't method dependent (some have diaries, others fancy apps, some have flash cards, others seem to just keep it in memory, and actual process/prioritizing/workflow vary hugely), and might be better explained by virtue of high-conscientiousness predicting high achievement, rather than better task-management improving output controlling for selection-by-conscientiousness

All this isn't very good anecdotal data, but the support you give for GTD as isn't that compelling either: although common sense and popular opinion are correlated with the truth, I think there's (justified) scepticism about commonsense, popular opinion, or anecdotal reports of success (we'd want better than that when deciding whether or not to spend our money - so why not on how to spend our time, too?). You mention that 'But there is also scientific evidence that supports some components of task management', but you don't elaborate. Please do! I don't know of any good data re. methods of task management and improved productivity, so I'd like to find out. (This would seem an area of high-impact research).

My underlying worry is this: if you look at great writers, the 'methods' they used to compose their great works varied enormously. Hemingway had to use a typewriter whilst standing, Nabokov used flashcards with paragraphs on, Pullman always went down to the shed in his garden, etc. etc. Now, there might be underlying similarities (cf. Newport's idea of 'deep work'), but recommending all aspiring writers use flashcards or get standing typewriters seems unlikely to help. Similarly, people who 'get things done' might share underlying features (IQ, conscientiousness, executive function), but it is not clear to me the particular methods they use to organise/task manage is one of them. If so, then recommending folks adopt a particular method (like GTD) will not make them more productive.

Enjoy life!

Also note that he’s arguing in favor of some kind of task management system, not necessarily GTD, although a simplified version of GTD seems like the best right now.

* Goal setting has a pretty strong evidence base for increasing output (at least if done right) - see the article Richard links to. Task management systems encourage you to systematically goal set.
* It also encourages you to make your tasks precise - there’s other studies suggesting that this also makes you more likely to do them
* A major benefit is peace of mind. There aren’t proper trials showing that GTD leads to more peace of mind compared to other alternatives, but it’s one of those situations where all that matters is that it works for you. This in turn leads to conserved will power etc.
* Another major benefit is not forgetting things. I think it’s pretty clear that a task management system of some sort is going to make you less likely to forget things. 

I think the main reason they’re not more widely used is that people don’t know about them, and it’s seen as a bit unusual. It’s also much less useful when you’re a student and mostly just have to manage your studies, which might explain why you don’t see it more among your peers. In other professions when high output is really important, people effectively have a task management system via their PA.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>1046</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1348</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Richard Batty</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>rjlbatty@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/richard-batty</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-09-28 14:50:08</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks Ben, I think you answered better than I would be able to.

I would add that it's cheap to try it out - just test using a task management system for a month and see what it's like. There's no need to be 'highly skeptical' based on anecdotal data. You can just experiment with yourself.

Also, I'd expect task management to be used much more by people on a [manager's schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) - i.e. people juggling lots of small tasks, rather than people doing deep work on large projects. Therefore, if you're mainly doing deep work on large projects, you might not find it so useful. And this may be the reason you don't see task management being used by people you know - perhaps you don't know many successful managers and organisers.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>1046</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1047</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>William Saunders</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>william_r_s@sympatico.ca</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/william-saunders</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-05-06 23:16:16</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hmm... reading the post and the above reply suggested a thought: are there useful methods for measuring one's productivity?

At first sight, it’s hard to know where to begin. Or what this even means. Indeed, many people don’t think it’s even possible to work this out!

[We don’t agree](http://80000hours.org/blog/189-can-you-measure-the-good-you-ll-do). If you don’t try to weigh up your options, you’ll end up doing far less for the world than you could otherwise be doing. And you could achieve [so much](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oihS0Cx8Lcs).

How, then, do we go about helping you decide in which career can you make the most difference? It’s not an easy question, but it is a fascinating one that has a great deal of importance to the world.

#What factors are the most important?

After talking one-on-one with around 100 people about their careers, asking people who have made a big impact, and thinking through what matters, we’ve developed an initial simple framework for assessing the value of different careers. 

We expect this framework will develop significantly and become more precise over time as we come to gain a better grasp over which factors matter. It just represents our best guess at which key factors are most important, organised in a way that we’ve found relatively easy to understand and evaluate separately.

We present an overview of the framework in our second intro video:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/u2XNfeIASoA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true">

</iframe>

In summary, we find it useful to judge careers on two key factors:
* Immediate Impact
* Building career capital

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/206/original/careervalueeqn.jpg?1374841674'><img alt="Careervalueeqn" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/206/large/careervalueeqn.jpg?1374841674" /></a>

We break immediate impact down further into: the size of your contribution multiplied by the effectiveness of the cause you work on.

We break career capital down into: skills, network and CV points.

In the rest of this post, I’ll go over these factors in more detail.


##1)  Immediate Impact

**This is the immediate scope you have to make the world a better place through this career over the next couple of years.**

We break this down into the multiple of two further factors.

[Impact = Contribution * Cause Effectiveness]

###a) Contribution

In some careers, you have more ability to contribute to important problems than others. Simply put, Presidents are more influential than sandwich makers. There are many ways to contribute to a cause, including:
* Gaining a **public platform** and using it to spread an important idea
* Gaining a **network** and using it to spread an idea or carry out a project
* **Donating money**
* **Influencing budgets** in existing organisations or by building a new organisation
* In addition, there’s the **direct contribution** you make through your work

It’s often useful to assess careers on how much contribution you’ll be able to make along each of these dimensions.

###b) Cause effectiveness

With some problems, a small contribution can go a long way. With others, you can devote your entire life to it, and not make any difference. Some problems are not worth solving - like cops running out of donuts. Other problems are important, but really hard to do anything about - like making a perpetual motion machine to provide free energy for ever.

To make a big difference, you’ll want to work on the problems where your contribution will go as far as possible. These are **problems which are both important - worth doing something about - and tractable - it’s possible to do something about them**. We call these effective causes.

I’ll write about which causes seem most effective in an upcoming post.


###The multiple of the two

You have the most immediate impact when you can make a big contribution to an effective cause.

The relation seems to be multiplicative. If your contribution increases by 10x, then so does your impact. Likewise with the effectiveness of your cause.


##2) Building Career Capital

This is the extent to which the career path builds your general ability to take high impact opportunities in the future.

We find it useful to separate out this factor from immediate impact for two reasons. (i) Beyond 3-5 years, it’s very uncertain what projects most people will be working on, thus we don’t find it very useful to try to evaluate the impact of these projects. Rather, we prefer to evaluate your *general potential* to have an impact. We call this your career capital. (ii) Your long-term general potential is often more important than your immediate impact. First, it’s because most careers only peak after around 20 years[^2] - you’ll be having more impact when you manage the charity rather than intern for it. Second, it’s because keeping your options open is highly important in itself (as we’ll explain in a future post). This is because your thoughts on which cause is most important are very likely to change. We think building career capital is a very important way to keep your options open (though there can be other ways). Since building career capital is important in itself, it’s useful to separate from immediate impact and control the balance between the two.

We break down career capital into the quality of your network, skills and CV.

###a) Network

Many jobs are landed [through the people you know](http://80000hours.org/blog/175-how-important-is-networking-for-career-success). Thus, if you know more influential people, it should increase your opportunities in the future to get jobs. Your network is also a direct source of impact. Simply put, it’s easier to lobby the government if you know a senator.


###b) Skills

In the future, you’ll need connections to get your foot in the door, but people will ultimately hire you for your skills. Moreover, your skills are what you’ll actually use, in addition to your network, to make a difference. We define your skills as any aspect of your ability to get stuff done that can be improved with practice. Your intelligence and personality are *relatively* fixed, but a skill like the ability to fundraise, can (to a significant extent) be learned.

With training, we think it’s possible to increase your ability to get stuff done a great deal, at least in many areas. We largely believe this due to the literature on expert performance[^1]. So that means skill development is very important.


###3) CV Points

Some jobs help you gain further opportunities for reasons over and above the usefulness of the skills and network you gain. This is sometimes because they are prerequisites for further jobs. For instance, you won’t be considered for a career as a lawyer unless you have the right qualifications, even if you know all you need to know. Some careers or qualifications are also useful as a means of signalling your ability to others. In practice, people can’t assess everything about you, so they’ll resort to rules of thumb: like what schools and qualifications are generally regarded as impressive or difficult. For instance, [it becomes much harder to get into finance without graduating from an elite school](http://infoproc.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/credentialism-and-elite-employment.html), regardless of your true skill. It’s important to take these factors into account too.


###How to combine these three sub-factors?

None of the factors seem obviously more important than the others in general, so at this stage, I’d recommend equally weighting them. If forced to choose, I’d put them in the order they are above.

In practice, it will also depend a great deal on the individual, since some people will be more limited by one area than another.



##So in which careers can you make the most difference?

We’ve argued that [keeping your options open](http://80000hours.org/blog/233-how-important-is-keeping-your-options-open) is very important for effective altruists - probably at least comparable to your immediate impact. This means that building career capital (which seems to be the main way to improve your options), is at least as important as your immediate impact.

Indeed, for many effective altruists, especially those at the start of their career, building career capital is likely to be several times more important than their immediate impact.

So, to find the best career for you, first focus on finding the careers that are best for building your career, then factor in your immediate impact.

Which specific careers look particularly promising in general? We explore this in a future post.

###Expected value estimates

Ideally you’d [estimate a range](http://80000hours.org/blog/170-how-to-make-estimates-part-i) for the contribution factors (in the right units) and a range for cause effectiveness (in the right units) and [combine them](http://80000hours.org/blog/171-estimation-part-ii-how-much-will-you-earn) to produce a confidence interval for the expected value of the impact of the career.

In some cases, this may be possible. In our experience, however, the state of the data generally isn’t good enough to make this very easy, and even if possible, the models are likely to be very simple and fragile, which can easily make them misleading.

At this stage, we generally focus our efforts on using qualitative arguments to identify the most important factors, and then intuitively weigh up between them. We try to inform our approach with numbers wherever possible, but we rarely make explicit expected value estimates.

This is somewhat similar from how Givewell, despite maintaining the goal to maximise cost-effectiveness, [reduced their reliance on explicit expected value estimates](http://blog.givewell.org/2011/11/04/some-considerations-against-more-investment-in-cost-effectiveness-estimates/) when they moved into more speculative areas of charity evaluation. Jonah Sinik has recently argued for focusing more on qualitative arguments [here](http://lesswrong.com/lw/hif/robustness_of_costeffectiveness_estimates_and/), which increases our confidence in this approach.

This evaluation framework is firstly a conceptual framework to help you think through the key issues. To make it one step more quantitative, you could define a weight for each factor, score on each factor (fitting your scorings to a distribution, so as not to accidentally change your weightings), then combine the factors into an overall estimate of value. We plan to experiment with approaches along these lines.

What you do here is to look at what groups (!) have on average the highest impact  (e.g. people in finance, lawyers, any group with high income) and say doing what these groups do provides the highest impact. However, in the end these successful groups provide only a marginal impact compared to very successful individuals (say 1 Bill Gates has the 1000-fold impact of an individual in finance). I think before being confident that your reasoning is true (that one should follow the group of individuals that on average has the highest impact), you have to show that it is not possible or unlikely to become one of these exceptionally successful individuals (that it is a mere chance event). However, research definitely shows that becoming a exceptionally successful individual is not a mere chance event: The combination of supportive, nurturing parents; early deliberate practice; experienced, supportive mentors; and moderate to high IQ provide a very good chance to become an individual with exceptional impact. What is needed here is a game theoretical mathematical model which approximates which route of career (doing what high impact groups do; or doing what very high impact individuals do) provides the highest payoff with a given personal background (IQ, talents, support by parents, access to experienced mentors etc.).

But what’s the best way of learning? The most promising method is spaced repetition - flashcards done well.

##Learn more effectively using a spaced repetition system
Imagine that one day you learned that the capital of Ethiopia was Addis Ababa. If you were tested the next day, you’d have a high chance of remembering this. If instead you were tested the next week, you’d have a lower chance of remembering it. This is common sense, and can be represented by a curve that shows your forgetting over time. If you review the item some days later, you then get a new, more gradual forgetting curve:


<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/145/original/forgetting_curve_102.png?1368626524'><img alt="Forgetting_curve_102" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/145/large/forgetting_curve_102.png?1368626524" /></a>


You will forget slower this time, because this is your second review. This means that if you want to learn efficiently, you should learn something, then review it at intervals later, but that the intervals should get wider and wider:

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/143/original/forgettingcurve101.jpg?1368625999'><img alt="Forgettingcurve101" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/143/large/forgettingcurve101.jpg?1368625999" /></a>

As well as this optimal pattern of review, psychologists have shown[^1] that active recall (i.e. practice testing) is better than passive recall - i.e. it is better to review by asking “What is the capital of Ethiopia” and forcing yourself to answer than to review by simply reading “The capital of Ethiopia is Addis Ababa”.

Spaced repetition software uses these principles. You make question-and-answer flashcards and when you’ve answered a question the software works out the best time to test you again. So all the scheduling is taken care of for you.

But can you use this technique to learn complex information rather than simple facts such as world capitals? According to people who have tried it, yes, it’s possible. You just need to make sure you break down the information in the right way. This list of [20 rules](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm) for writing flashcards will help you break down complex information. And for an example of how to learn complex information using flashcards have a look at [this detailed guide](http://www.jackkinsella.ie/2011/12/05/janki-method.html) by someone who has used spaced repetition to study computer programming.

##What are the benefits?
If you can accelerate your learning then you’ll be able to learn more information useful for your job. You also get compound benefits from knowledge. The more you know, the more easily you can learn related topics and make links between different areas of knowledge to come up with novel solutions. There are lots of useful things you could learn: if you’re a student you could study your subject more efficiently. If your job involves a lot of networking you could use spaced repetition to learn names and information about people that you need to remember. Every time you come across something useful you didn’t know, you can make a new flashcard in seconds.

##What are the potential costs?
Daily spaced repetition costs vary dependent on how many cards you review each day. I just reviewed 36 cards in 6 minutes, for example. However, it’s a very efficient way of learning things. The spacing means that you can maintain a deck of thousands of cards and still only take 15 minutes a day to review (depending on how fast you add cards). Given that the software finds a close-to-optimum schedule of reviewing, any other schedule of review would either take more time or would cause you to forget more.

[Gwern](http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition#using-it) estimates that at the very most, you’d spend 5 minutes over the course of your lifetime on each card. “if, over your lifetime, you will spend more than 5 minutes looking something up or will lose more than 5 minutes as a result of not knowing something, then it’s worthwhile to memorize it with spaced repetition. 5 minutes is the line that divides trivia from useful data.”

##How strong is the evidence?
Some psychologists recently published a [review](https://www.wku.edu/senate/documents/improving_student_learning_dunlosky_2013.pdf) of the best learning methods. They found that practice testing and distributed practice (where you space practice sessions over time rather than cramming all at once) came out top. Both of these methods are used in [spaced repetition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition). You can see a full review of the evidence for spaced repetition [here](http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition).

##Our recommendation
* Choose something to learn - start with something that’s fairly easy to break down into small facts, but make sure that you actually care about learning it, otherwise you won’t want to do the reviews.
* Read [20 rules for writing effective flashcards](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm)

**Software**

* [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) - free and easy to use.
* [Memrise](http://www.memrise.com/) - web-based system with a game-like setup and lots of cards for language learning.

>*“I can’t seem to find the “right” career for me. I don’t have anything I’m passionate about, and I don’t feel like I have any skills that particularly set me out from the crowd. I don’t want to be doing what I’m doing now for the rest of my life, but until I find something that fits my skills and interests, it'll do.”*

There’s an assumption here that I think is implicit in a lot of talk about career choice: that it’s ultimately just a matter of sifting through all the possibilities and picking the best option given certain constraints. 

The problem with this is that it assumes you, your skills, your strengths, are fixed, and finding the “right” career is simply a matter of finding the best way to apply them. It also relies to some extent on being able to predict how your career will unfold over time. But if you want to have a successful career, you need to be constantly looking to improve and thinking about what skills are most worth investing in developing. 

If you want to make a difference, you need to be able to adapt to changes in the world around you.

#Your career is like a startup

We think that we can draw many useful insights about career planning from thinking about how startups operate successfully. We started looking into how people typically plan their careers, and noticed a number of problems. One particular concern was that career plans often tend to be overly detailed in the long term, which makes it difficult to adapt to change and can narrow focus. 

Looking for potential solutions to this problem, we started looking to other fields for inspiration. In an ideal world, we’d be focusing more directly on research in career planning. Sadly, very little such research exists (yet!), so drawing on research and methods from related fields and trying to find as solid a backing as possible for these comparisons seems the next best approach. We found the field of entrepreneurship to be pretty promising for this: I’ll elaborate on some of the reasons for this below.

##Key takeaways from startup strategy for your career:
</br>

1. **Stop looking for the perfect job to match your existing skills and interests**, and getting discouraged when this turns out to be a struggle. Instead focus on getting experience and building the skills that will give you great opportunities in the future. We’ll be talking more about how to do this in a later post.

2. **Ditch the rigid career plan**. Instead set out your key aims and make hypotheses about how you might achieve them, and focus on testing and updating these as you learn more. 

##Justification: why focus on the field of entrepreneurship?
</br>

* **There seem to be a lot of direct analogies between startup strategy and career planning:** both mean finding a niche where you can excel and beat the competition, and both require doing so in a highly uncertain and changing environment.

* Entrepreneurship is highly competitive and has clear success outcomes (profit!) So **it seems like there’s good reason to expect the field to develop good methods.**

* Since first noting that this might be a useful comparison, **we’ve talked with other professionals and social entrepreneurs thinking both about career choice and business strategy**, who seem to be thinking in similar ways and support the analogy when pointed out. [Matt Scott](http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/skoll/about/Pages/MattScott.aspx) at the [Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship](http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/skoll/Pages/default.aspx) in Oxford, who provides career coaching to MBA students, has been particularly helpful in discussing and giving feedback on these ideas, having come to similar conclusions himself. 

* We’ve also since discovered that **notable others have come up with similar ideas independently**: [including Reid Hoffman](http://www.thestartupofyou.com/), the co-founder of LinkedIn!

* **It seems to provide a useful framework for dealing with some of the problems posed by conventional career planning.** We’ve confirmed this by testing and iterating different processes based on principles from startup strategy in advising sessions and workshops, and received increasing levels of positive feedback.

*The Lean Startup Cycle: Build, Measure, Learn.*

**Have a career model, not a plan**

[This article](http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2012/11/26/start-with-a-business-model-not-a-business-plan/) opens with the story of a young entrepreneur who planned his startup extensively: 60 pages and 12 spreadsheets, to be exact. But when he went out into the “real world” and tried to execute the plan, everything fell apart: the real world didn’t work as his plan predicted! He’d spent so much time planning, thinking through and justifying assumptions, but had neglected to actually go out of the building and talk to customers. The result was that when he finally did, he found half of the assumptions in his perfectly executed plan were wrong.

The advice given in the quoted article for dealing with this type of situation is that one should start with a business *model*, not a business *plan.* What’s the difference? A business plan tells you *what to go out and do*: assuming that you already understand the environment you’re working in. A business model, on the other hand, *sets out the core aims and hypotheses* of a business, but is designed to be flexible and change rapidly as you learn more. A plan’s focus is execution, whereas a model is much more centered around learning.

In an earlier post I discussed some of the [pros and cons of career planning](http://80000hours.org/blog/164-should-you-plan-your-career). There seemed to be a conflict here: that plans can both help by providing direction and motivation, yet also hinder by narrowing focus and inhibiting learning. Having some kind of career “model”, as opposed to a rigid plan seems to potentially provide the solution here. The key idea - inspired by good traditional business practice - is to have a long-term vision plus a short term plan, which provides direction whilst also leaving you open to change and learning.

 I’ll talk more about how to create a “model”  for your career in an upcoming post.

**Think lean: everything is a best guess**

[The Lean Startup movement](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) is a new approach to product development in startup businesses popularised by Eric Ries in 2008. It’s since transformed into a movement that’s spread to entrepreneurs throughout the world. What’s key to the lean startup approach is that building a successful business isn’t simply a matter of having a great product idea and executing it. 

All too often startups have an idea for a product they think people want, spend months or years perfecting the product without ever actually showing the product to customers. This means they are operating completely blindly, with no real idea of whether the product is actually something the customer wants at all - many startups fail because it’s not until they release a product that they realise its flaws. The lean startup solution to this is iterative product releases of a [‘minimum viable product’](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html), measuring feedback, and learning.

One useful takeaway is the idea that, when thinking about the future of your career, everything should be a “best guess.” As emphasised by the “have a model, not a plan” approach, it’s important to think about what your career aims are, and how you might concretely achieve them, but also to recognise that these will inevitably change as time progresses, and be prepared to learn and adapt. One way of doing this is to get into the habit of identifying key uncertainties, and then actively seeking feedback from the world to resolve them. What question or piece of information are you most uncertain about that will most affect your career plans? How might you resolve this uncertainty? Speaking to people, doing research, or simply trying things out are a number of ways in which you might get feedback to resolve key uncertainties.

**Treat yourself as a work-in-progress**

In startups, the focus on testing, learning and improving means that the attitude to product development should be one of being a “work in progress”, never “complete”, with constant room for improvement. The same attitude applies to you and your career. Any job you take is a development opportunity: the chance to both build skills and experience, and learn more about what you enjoy and can contribute to the world through your career.

Certainly the "make a difference" aspect is 80k's unique selling point, and where we are generating the most value, in terms of research. But in order to advise people how to pursue the careers that do the most good, we do need to also understand the general principles behind choosing a career well. And if, in the course of understanding that, Jess thinks of a new and useful analogy, then I think it makes sense for her to write that up on the blog. It would be bad if that was a large component of what we talk about - but I don't think we're at that stage yet.

However, such posts become more worrying if the advice that's good for choosing-a-career-in-general is actively bad advice for choosing a career-that-will-help-others. And there is the following disanalogy, which means that you should be careful with the startup idea when applying it to altruistic careers:

When starting a company, or when pursuing a career in order to have a good life (rather than in order to help others), the feedback one gets is directly relevant to one's decision. So you can experiment by interning at company X, then if you enjoy it, great, and if you don't, that's also great, because you've learned something. You've learned directly whether working at a company like company X is something you want to do.

In the case of careers-to-help-others, this sometimes still relevant. In order to make the biggest possible difference, you do need to find out what you're most interested in (what will get you out of bed in the morning), where your skills are etc. But you typically don't get direct feedback about how much you helped others at company X. In fact, the positive feedback can be misleading. Suppose you try working for both charity X and charity Y. Charity X is a really ineffective charity, but you excel while working there - you really enjoy it, all your peers tell you how great you are, etc. Charity Y is a really effective charity, but you just do ok - you find it reasonably enjoyable, but not spectacular, your peers say you're doing ok. In a sense, you got much better feedback from Charity X than Charity Y. But you might have done much more good working for Charity Y, because it's so much more effective.

Moreover, the best way to find out whether Charity Y is more effective than Charity Y isn't by working for them. Rather, it's to do GiveWell-style research - which involves sitting at a desk, finding what information is available, and working things out, rather than experimenting directly.

So, in brief:

For altruistic career choice, learning is *even more* important than for self-interested career choice. I expect our state of knowledge related to how to do good to shift by much more over the next few years than our state of knowledge about how to do well. And our conclusions about how best to do good might shift much more radically than our conclusions about how best to do well. 

But, for altruistic career choice, figuring out what to do through bookish research is comparatively more important than going out into the world and experimenting with different career choices. That's because you get little direct feedback about how much good you're doing by experimenting with different career choices (but you do get direct feedback about how well you're doing).

None of this is to criticise Jess's post - but just to highlight that it's important to be careful how you use some of the general-purpose career advice in the context of altruistic careers.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1282</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Andrew</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>spaeker@hotmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-08-25 14:40:48</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[An intriguing idea but I fear only works if you're set on an MBA or ACA type career path.

A successful early career is an important (or even the most important) step in having an impactful life. However, I am not quite convinced that 80k is the right place for such ideas as “Your career is a lean startup!”: 80k members are well aware about the idea of replaceability – you have a good impact while being a doctor, however, if you do something else there is little loss of overall positive impact in the world, as you are easily replaced as a doctor. You can apply this idea also to these blog post: Blog posts that deal with how to have early career success are ubiquitous around the internet and if it is not posted here the overall impact does not change much (I think 80k members are well aware that accumulating credentials is most important in an early career). However, if the blog post would deal with unique 80k thinking the overall positive impact on the EA movement might increase. Key ideas like replacebility or to expect average outcomes in one’s career are unique ideas to 80k thinking and hugely important to understand what careers are high impact and which are not. Therefore, I would highly welcome if the blog post would expand on important ideas that are unique to 80k rather than focusing on how to have a successful career. ]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Is microcredit mostly hype?</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/123-is-microcredit-mostly-hype</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[<br>

<center><a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/60/original/lize.jpg?1353860890'><img alt="Lize" class="image small" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/60/medium/lize.jpg?1353860890" /></a></center>

>In 2002, Lize, a widow with 5 children, was unable to work for three months due to illness. When she recovered, many of her fishing nets were ruined. Lize decided to apply for a loan with Hluvuku-Adsema Fundo de Credito Male Yeru...Since then she has been granted four loans, the first one in January 2003 for a total of around US$260... With these basic financial services, Lize's commercial activities recovered allowing her to support her extended family of sixteen members and start building a new concrete house. In addition, her company has generated four permanent job posts, seven temporary ones, and supports the business of self-employed women that buy her fish to sell in Catembe and Maputo.


This [story](http://www.yearofmicrocredit.org/pages/whyayear/whyayear_whatclientssay.asp#lize) is typical of those used to promote microcredit: the practice of providing small loans to the global poor who don’t have access to existing lending services. Microcredit is a type of microfinance, which includes a variety other financial services provided on a small scale. Microcredit is an intuitively appealing idea, especially for market-oriented people: the global poor can lift themselves sustainably out of poverty, all they need is some capital to start a business! 

And it seems to have become one of the most popular ideas in charity. 2005 was named the [‘Year of Microcredit’](http://www.yearofmicrocredit.org/).The microcredit charity [Kiva](http://www.kiva.org) has over 800,000 lenders, the highest possible rating from Charity Navigator, and was [endorsed by Oprah](http://www.kiva.org/updates/kiva/2010/11/19/kiva-chosen-as-one-of-oprahs-favorite.html)... The [2006 Nobel Committee](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/press.html) boldly claimed that microcredit “must play a major part” in ending global poverty.

Recently, however, criticism of microfinance has [been growing](http://www.oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/?p=5161). And that’s a good thing, because **it’s far from proven that microfinance, on average, has any positive effects at all.**

&nbsp;

1) **It’s not clearly shown that microcredit makes people better off**

Major studies of microfinance struggle to demonstrate causation. The conclusion of Duvendack et al. is typical: “it is widely acknowledged that no well-known study robustly shows any strong impacts of microfinance.”[^1]

[Randomized control trials](http://www.bmj.com/content/316/7126/201), which can potentially overcome this problem, tend to find that microcredit has little or no benefits.

There have been few studies, but two of the major ones didn’t find any effect. A study in the Philippines found that people provided with microfinance didn’t believe they were any better off. [^2] A study by JPAL found that although more businesses were started in the area, there was no effect on business profits, female empowerment, health or education.[^3] Clearly more research is needed, since this is counterintuitive result. But so far, despite the hype, there isn’t good evidence that microcredit has large benefits.

&nbsp;

2) **Microcredit is not free or sustainable**

Microfinance is attractive because you can loan people money, they pay it back, then you can loan it out again, and again, and again. Or so the story goes. 

In reality, microfinance charities incur substantial operational expenses and if the lending occurs at below full interest rates, then it’s more like a cash transfer in disguise. It costs [Givewell’s top recommended](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/Small-Enterprise-Foundation#footnote60_40rxcyl) microfinance charity, the [Small Enterprise Foundation](http://www.sef.co.za/), $128 per client served.[^4] At $5 per net, this is enough to protect about 40 people from malaria.

&nbsp;

3) **High ‘repayment rates’ can be seriously misleading**

The major microcredit charities typically advertise repayment rates over 97%. But there’s no clear definition of what this means. Common definitions of the loan loss rate are often something like “loans lost” divided by “loans outstanding”. This means the measure will be inflated by simply increasing the number of loans outstanding. Since most microfinance institutions are growing, this figure is typically inflated. See GiveWell’s excellent [article](http://blog.givewell.org/2009/09/18/what-does-the-repayment-rate-really-tell-you-about-the-impact-of-microfinance/), and a more recent [one](http://blog.givewell.org/2010/01/22/more-on-the-microfinance-repayment-rate/) for more.

&nbsp;

4) **A substantial number of borrowers seem to be harmed by the loans**

By surveying MixMarket.com, Givewell found that [20-40%](http://blog.givewell.org/2009/12/21/is-borrowing-good-for-the-borrowers/) of clients drop out of microcredit schemes. It’s unclear why, but the evidence that exists suggests that it’s very unlikely to be success. The [most common reason](http://blog.givewell.org/2009/12/21/is-borrowing-good-for-the-borrowers/), at around 30-50% of drop outs, seems to be “business failure.” It’s likely that some of these borrowers end up worse-off than they were before they took the loans.

&nbsp;

5) **Microcredit doesn’t seem to be the best type of microfinance**

It’s much less sexy, but one randomized control trial showed that providing zero-interest savings accounts increased investment and how much money people were able to spend.[^5]

Against conventional microfinance wisdom, a study also found that providing *consumer* loans (loans to buy goods, not for starting businesses) in South Africa increased income and employment.[^6]

This is only two studies, so we can’t draw strong lessons from them. Nevertheless, the evidence we have suggests that microcredit is not the most promising area of microfinance.

&nbsp;

**Conclusion**

Instead of living up to the hype, microcredit is full of myths. There isn’t much direct evidence that it improves welfare. At best, we have some reason to think that microcredit is a service people want, since they often pay considerable amounts of interest for the loans. So, we’d expect it to be doing some good overall. But it’s not a service that seems to have particularly large social returns compared to the other services one could sell to the global poor. A lot more research is needed. In the meantime, it seems that microcredit charities would have more impact by shifting towards consumer loans and microsavings.

6) There is mounting evidence that MF encourages parents to withdraw their children from school to work in "micro sweat-shops".

7) Interest rates are insanely high, often over 100% and occasionally over 200%. Do we really expect the poor to accumulate wealth while paying such rates (although MF investors may)? Kiva may have won some awards, but they don't even publish interest rates charged to the poor. In fact, no such P2Ps or microfinance investment funds publish these rates. Why not?

8) Even when a micro-business grows, to what extent is this simply displacing another person in the market? When Wal-Mart opens a new store local mon-and-pop stores may close, surely the same happens in MF?

9) Chronic over-indebtedness is the #1 facing the sector according to the 2012 Banana Skins report. There is too much, not too little capital in the sector.

10) The funds and P2Ps are extremely opaque, and relying predominantly on nice photos and stories as suggested here, with very little hard data to actually enable a potential investor to make an informed decision, relying on the hype and emotion of the "idea". Why the US and European regulators permit such companies to take money from their general public while the rest of the financial services sector have to comply with far more stringent rules of disclosure is a mystery to me, but demonstrates how far up the fanaticism for MF reaches.

11) The self-regulatory initiatives are a joke, funded by insiders, are ineffective in practice, permit membership of some of the worst offenders in the entire sector, and are pure window-dressing designed to reassure naive investors that all is well and maintain the flow of funding into the "miracle cure". 

Not all MF is nonsense, but the good guys are needles in a haystack, while the shady guys are wolves dressed in sheep's clothing, and unless you know exactly how to distinguish between the two, I would advise extreme caution investing in this sector for anyone with a trace of social motivation. If you simply want to exploit the poor via extortionate loans immune from any regulatory scrutiny, then this is the best sector on Earth.

Mohamed Yunis always says he got the idea for the Grameen bank by looking at how poor people in a village he was involved with would go to loan sharks, and the horrible impacts that would have.

“After two decades of successfully applying the power of relationships in my own life and career, I’ve come to believe that connecting is one of the most important business - and life - skill sets you’ll ever learn. Why? Because, flat out, people do business with people they know and like. Careers - in every imaginable field - work the same way.”
-- Keith Ferrazzi, Author of [Never Eat Alone](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Never-Eat-Alone-Secrets-Relationship/dp/0385512058)

Many business books and careers advice websites claim that networking is essential for career success.[^1] It’s something that many job-hunters think they should be doing, but is it actually helpful? The evidence suggests yes.

<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/mcclanahan/8252916928/'><img alt="Birds_networking" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/125/large/birds_networking.jpg?1365604785" /></a>

There have been several studies that show more workers find out about new jobs through their personal network than any other method.[^2] For example, a study of workers in the Quebec provincial government[^3] found that 42.7% of the 2553 people in the study had found the job through personal contacts despite the government’s efforts to formalise the application process. An unpublished study[^4] of 1780 people in the Philadelphia area found that 56% of those who weren’t self employed got their current job with significant help from another person.

A longitudinal study that questioned people on their networking behaviours and then recorded their salary over three years found that networking was related to salary growth.[^5] There is also some evidence that you’re more likely to find a job through your acquaintances than through close friends.[^6] Also, often as you become more senior in an organisation, networking becomes more important as your productivity relies more on managing people and bringing in business through contacts.

Though more evidence is needed, this shows that networking is a key skill for career success.

What this means for you:

Key recommendation:

* Learn more about networking from people who do it well and then go out and do it. [Never Eat Alone](http://www.amazon.com/Never-Eat-Alone-Secrets-Relationship/dp/0385512058) is the most useful book we’ve come across on networking in a non-creepy way. Blogger and entrepreneur Ramit Sethi has a lot of good material on networking, e.g. [this](http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/video-how-to-use-natural-networking-to-connect-with-anyone/), and [this](http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/ramits-definitive-guide-to-building-your-network-with-scripts/)

And remember:
* Don’t rely exclusively on impersonal methods of finding jobs, such as through websites - many jobs are found through personal contacts.
* Test out cultivating acquaintanceships with a variety of people to see if you gain a usefully wider insight about the world, and especially about the job market. Get to know people who are higher up the career ladder than you - they can provide valuable advice and help.

Lots of social interventions end up doing more harm than good. Many more make no difference at all, and are just a waste of resources. At times, we’ve probably argued with friends about which interventions we’d like to see, and which we wouldn’t. But are we any good at judging what’s likely to work?

Try and guess which of these eight programs made a difference, which had no effect, and which made things worse. At least some had a positive effect.

* * *

**Round #1: Scared Straight**

*Program description*: “In the 1970s, inmates serving life sentences at a New Jersey (USA) prison began a program to ‘scare’ or deter at‐risk or delinquent children from a future life of crime. The program, known as ‘Scared Straight’, featured as its main component an aggressive presentation by inmates to juveniles visiting the prison facility. The presentation depicted life in adult prisons, and often included exaggerated stories of rape and murder … The program received considerable and favorable media attention and was soon replicated in over 30 jurisdictions nationwide … Although the harsh and sometimes vulgar presentation in the earlier New Jersey version is the most famous, inmate presentations are now sometimes designed to be more educational than confrontational but with a similar crime prevention goal. Some of these programs featured interactive discussions between the inmates and juveniles, also referred to as ‘rap sessions.’(2)

*Did the program decrease the rate of juvenile crime?*


**Round #2: Nurse‐Family Partnership**

*Program description*: “The Nurse‐Family Partnership program provides nurse home visits to pregnant women with no previous live births, most of whom are i) low‐income, ii) unmarried, and iii) teenagers. The nurses visit the women approximately once per month during their pregnancy and the first two years of their children’s lives. The nurses teach i) positive health related behaviors, ii) competent care of children, and iii) maternal personal development (family planning, educational achievement, and participation in the workforce). The program costs approximately $12,500 per woman over the three years of visits (in 2010 dollars).”(6)

*Did the program improve the quality of child care?*
  

**Round #3: Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE)**

*Program description*: “DARE is a highly‐structured substance‐abuse prevention program taught by uniformed police officers … The program is typically provided over the course of 10‐20 weekly hour‐long sessions, during which the police officers use lectures, class discussion, role plays, and homework assignments to i) teach students about substance use and its effects, ii) teach students decision‐making and peer pressure resistance skills, and iii) boost students’ self‐esteem. Prior to teaching, the police officers take an 80‐hour training course on teaching techniques, classroom management, and the DARE curriculum … DARE costs approximately $130 (in 2004 dollars) per student  and, as of 2001, was operating in 75% of American school districts.”(8)

*Did the program decrease the rate of drug use?*
   

**Rounds #4 and #5: 21st Century Community Learning Centers**

*Program description*: “21st Century Community Learning centers is a large ($1 billion per year) US Department of Education program which funds optional after‐school programs for elementary and middle school students in mostly high‐poverty schools. Key goals of the program are to i) provide students with a safe place after school, and ii) improve their academic performance. Recipients of program funds (ie, school districts and/or non‐profit educational/community organizations) are required to provide academically focused “extended learning activities” (e.g., instructional enrichment programs, tutoring, or homework assistance). Most centers also offer enrichment/recreational activities such as martial arts, sports, dance, art and/or music … (Elementary school) centers vary in the activities they offer and other key features, and thus comprise a range of after‐school interventions rather than a single intervention. In a typical center,

1. students may spend an hour doing homework and having a snack, an hour on additional academic activity (eg, a lesson or working in a computer lab), and an hour doing recreational or cultural activities;

2. the center’s staff are a mixture of certified teachers, instructional aides, and representatives of community youth organizations;

3. the center is open 4‐5 days per week for three hours after school, and serves approximately 85 students per day; and

4. the average student attends the center 2‐3 days per week.

Centers spend approximately $1,000 (in 2005 dollars) on each enrolled student per year.”(10)

*Did the program increase the students’ academic achievement?*

*Did the program improve the behavioural problems at the schools?*
  

**Round #6: Even Start Family Literacy program**

*Program description*: “The Even Start program is intended to 'help break the cycle of poverty and illiteracy by improving the educational opportunities of the nation’s low‐income families by integrating early childhood education, adult literacy or adult basic education, and parenting education into a unified family literacy program'. In 2000‐2001, there were 855 Even Start projects serving 31,896 families … Even Start grantees had considerable flexibility in designing services to meet the needs of the low‐income families, but all were required to offer four services:

1. adult education to develop basic educational and literacy skills;

2. early childhood education services to provide developmentally appropriate services to help prepare children for school;

3. parenting education to help parents support the educational growth of their children; and

4. parent‐child literacy activities.”(13)

*Did the program increase literacy?*
   

**Round #7: Big Brothers Big Sisters**

*Program description*: “Big Brothers Big Sisters’ community‐based mentoring program matches youths aged 6‐18, predominantly from low‐income, single‐parent households, with adult volunteer mentors who are typically young (20‐34) and well‐educated (the majority are college graduates) … The mentor and youth typically meet for 2‐4 times per month for at least a year, and engage in activities of their choosing (e.g., studying, cooking, playing sports). The typical meeting lasts 3‐4 hours … For the first year, Big Brothers Big Sisters case workers maintain monthly contact with the mentor, as well as the youth and his or her parent, to insure a positive mentor‐youth match, and to help resolve any problems in the relationship. Mentors are encouraged to form a supportive friendship with the youths, as opposed to modifying the youth’s behavior or character… In 2008, Big Brothers Big Sisters served 255,000 youths and 470 agencies nationwide. The national average cost of making and supporting a match is approximately $1,300 in 2009 dollars.”(14)

*Did the program decrease drug use and violent behavior?*
  

**Round #8: Top 16 Educational Software**

*Program description*: “In the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002, Congress called for a rigorous study of the effectiveness of educational technology for improving student academic achievement … In fall 2003, developers and vendors of educational technology products responded to a public invitation and submitted products for possible inclusion in the national study. [Mathematica Policy Research, Inc.] staff selected 40 of the 160 submissions for further review by two panels of outside experts, one for reading products and one for math products … In January 2004, (the US Department of Education] considered the panel’s recommendations and selected 16 products for the study. In selecting products, (the US Department of Education) grouped them into four areas:

1. early reading (first grade),

2.  reading comprehension (fourth grade),

3. pre‐algebra (sixth grade), and

4. algebra (ninth grade).

The products ranged widely in their instructional approaches and how long they had been in use. In general, however, the criteria weighted the selection towards products that had evidence of effectiveness from previous research, or, for newer products, evidence that their designs were based on approaches found to be effective by research. Twelve of the sixteen products had received awards or been nominated for awards (some as recently as 2006) by trade associations, media, teachers, or parents.”(15)

**Round #1: Scared Straight**

**Negative!** Several randomized controlled trials have shown that Scared Straight had a negative effect. Going through Scared Straight made children *more* likely to commit crimes in the future (3). Fun fact: Scared Straight programs are still being run today (4), and people promote them as being effective, despite the fact that they are harmful (5).

**Round #2: Nurse‐Family Partnership**

**Positive!** Three randomized controlled trials have shown that the Nurse‐Family Partnership had a positive effect. The program led to a reduction in child abuse/neglect, child injuries (20‐50% reduction) and an improvement in cognitive/educational outcomes for children of mothers with low mental health/confidence/intelligence (e.g., 6 percentile point increase in grade 1‐6 in reading/math achievement) (7).

**Round #3: Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE)**

**No effect!**Two randomized controlled trials have shown that DARE did not have an effect on the rate of drug use among participants. The rate of drug use did not increase or decrease (9).

**Round #4: 21st Century Community Learning Centers**

**No effect!** A randomized controlled trial has shown that the 21st Century Community Learning Centers had no effect on participating students’ academic performance. Students who participated were neither helped nor harmed by the program.(11)

**Round #5: 21st Century Community Learning Centers**

**Negative!** A randomized controlled trial has shown that the 21st Century Community Learning Centers caused an increase in the behavioral problems of participating students (12).

**Round #6: Even Start Family Literacy Program**

**No effect!** A randomized controlled trial on a subset of Even Start programs found no evidence of an increase or decrease in literacy in parents or children (17).

**Round #7: Big Brothers Big Sisters**

**Positive!** A randomized controlled trial has shown that Big Brothers Big Sisters caused youths to be 46% less likely to have started using illegal drugs, 27% less likely to have started using alcohol, 32% less likely to have hit someone in the previous year and fewer days of skipping school during the past year (18).

**Round #8: Top 16 Educational Software**

**No effect!**The study described was a randomized controlled trial, and showed that the software did not make a noticeable difference in any of the categories. It did not help or hurt with 1) early reading (first grade), 2) reading comprehension (fourth grade), 3) pre‐ algebra (sixth grade), or 4) algebra (ninth grade) (19).

###How did you do?###
If you got 7-8 right, there’s less than a 1% chance you were guessing.
If you got 5-6 right, there was only an 8.5% chance you were guessing, so it might be skill.
If you got 1-4 right, then you did no better than randomly guessing.
If you got zero right … we could get useful information by always doing the opposite of what you do.

The effects of social interventions are extremely complex. All of these programs sound good, but unintended consequences can get in the way. It’s very difficult to work out what’s going to be successful ahead of time. Instead, we need to test, measure the results, and take it from there.

I was asked to clarify this, so here goes.

1 may have been in FN - I don't remember exactly, but something very similar was. In any case, the clear message from DSD is "if you punish people in a given environment, they'll just get sneakier; future punishment is not a good motivator".
2 seemed eminently sensible - FN's bit about how Roe v Wade caused crime to drop massively made me think that specific care for women who aren't experienced would be useful.
3 was primarily from personal experience - teaching in a formal setting just doesn't help on any matters of personal safety. But FN gave me a general ethos of "getting the police to do things doesn't work" - probably inappropriate for this example, but it was a source of intuition here.
4 I answered incorrectly, but in hindsight FN should have pointed me to saying it had no effect - FN was full of academic interventions of this type that failed. I answered this one wrongly because I was metagaming badly - I thought this and #5 couldn't both be non-positive (for some reason I can't really fathom, to do with them being studies of the same case).
5 I strongly thought would be negative (hence my ill-advised decision on #4) because DSD told me that an organised release of steam after school should lead to resentment during school.
6 had a similar case study in FN (about giving books to families) and IIRC it said similar schemes didn't work - that it's essentially down to how enthusiastic for learning the parent is, not how well-educated ey is. This program didn't strike me as an enthusiasm-increaser.
7 was clear to me from DSD: it's a sporadic positive reinforcer towards staying on the straight and narrow.
8 was based on my intuition that teaching in a formal environment is much, much more strongly down to the teacher than the software. A bad teacher will cause learning to stop no matter how good the tools the pupils are using, unless the tools are (like the Khan Academy) designed to supplant the teacher. A good teacher will teach well despite bad tools. Only in cases of mediocre teachers could I see the software making a difference, but FN suggested that mediocre teachers won't use it to its fullest advantage anyway (the not-particularly-relevant example from FN that springs to mind is the test scores study, with mediocre teachers cheating for the pupils on the multiple-choice tests - a low-effort approach to good results). FN supplied general intuition here without my being able to give a specific example.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>476</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Jeff Wu</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>wuthefwasthat@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-08-16 03:26:25</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[How were the interventions themselves chosen?

W/r/t 4 and 5, I correctly guessed both these items in advance when Holden presented them at the recent EA conference and asked for a show of hands on whether the measures would improve, stay the same, or decline.  Someone will probably remember this because I said "Yes!" out loud when Holden gave the unfortunate answers confirming my guesses, and several people laughed (I suppose that was a tad more Ravenclaw than Gryffindor, there).  I also mention this as partial demonstration that some of the ability I am claiming is confirmable.

Here are my complete notes:

***

1 - no
2 - tentative yes, but how did they measure 'improved child care'?  very ambiguous
3 - no
4 , 5 - no, no.  I correctly guessed both these items in advance when Holden presented it at the recent EA conference and asked for a show of hands on whether they would improve, stay the same, or decline.  Someone will probably remember this because I said "Yes!" out loud when Holden gave the unfortunate answers confirming my guesses, and several people laughed (I suppose that was a tad more Ravenclaw than Gryffindor, there).
6 - I suspect that the program measurements for increased literary will have been skewed.  A lot of these really need more specification of their measurements given the obvious incentive to pick skewed measuring tapes.  My ordinary guess would be that this program mostly fails to increase literacy (with a few shining internal counterexamples that don't shift the population average and are not imitated) but that the measurement would be distorted.  But since it's listed in a collection of 'against common sense' examples I will shift my expectation of the measured result from Yes to No.
7 - This is something I'd ordinarily expect to have a chance of working, as well as failing dramatically; there are plausible causal mechanisms going both ways.  Since there are supposed to be 'some' Yeses I'll tentatively guess that this was one of them.
8 - no

***

Note that some of my answer is due to my Tests Well trait and meta-reasoning.  This is unavoidable given the current format.  You would need to randomly select interventions from a database rather than looking for famous examples to avoid this.  In which case the answer would probably be an unbroken string of 'no effect'.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Internship opportunity in promoting charity cost-effectiveness</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/163-internship-opportunity-in-promoting-charity-cost-effectiveness</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/108/original/gwwc_internship_camp_pic.jpg?1362992732'><img alt="Gwwc_internship_camp_pic" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/108/large/gwwc_internship_camp_pic.jpg?1362992732" /></a>

Are you interested in learning how to research charity effectiveness? Want training in communicating the idea of effective giving? Or want experience in the non-profit sector?

Our sister organisation, [Giving What We Can](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org), is running a summer internship programme for students interested in promoting effective charitable giving. On the two-week programme (16th-27th September 2013) interns will gain training and experience in the area of their choice; either cost-effectiveness research or communications.

##The Future of Humanity Institute
[The Future of Humanity Institute](http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/) (Oxford) is a world-leading research centre looking at big-picture questions for human civilization.  With the tools of mathematics, philosophy, and science, we explore the risks and opportunities that will arise from technological change, weigh ethical dilemmas, and evaluate global priorities.  Our goal is to clarify the choices that will shape humanity’s long-term future.
 
##Who we need
We recently secured funding for a Research Collaboration with Amlin Insurance focusing on systemic risks associated with risk modelling.  This is a unique opportunity to build a world-leading research programme. We’re looking for someone who can not only manage this project, but who also has the drive and initiative to find new sources of funding, network with leading experts, and design future plans for the project. We’re also looking for someone who understands and is motivated by the aims of the FHI; the post-holder will have the opportunity to contribute across the board to FHI projects, and may be a crucial part of the FHI’s success going forward.
 
It’s a two year position, but there will be the possibility of extension depending on the success of the project and the acquisition of further funding. All the details can be found [here](http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/vacancy-academic-project-manager-at-the-future-of-humanity-institute/).
 
##Why can you make a big difference in this role?
[I’ve written in the past](http://80000hours.org/blog/152-bringing-it-all-together-high-impact-research-management) about the impact a talented person can have in academic project management.

##Systemic Risks
Systemic risks concern the stability of an entire market, and are of great importance to managing large-scale risk. The very methods used to model these phenomena can themselves be a source of systemic risk, especially when they embody hidden assumptions that may not remain reliable in a fast-changing world.

"More on the project

Systemic risks concern the stability of an entire market, and are of great importance to managing large-scale risk. The very methods used to model these phenomena can themselves be a source of systemic risk, especially when they embody hidden assumptions that may not remain reliable in a fast-changing world. The project will focus on gaining a better understanding of systemic risks, particularly as they apply to catastropic risk modelling, and ways to avoid or mitigate such risks. 

Subtopics of interest are likely to include:

Ways in which individually rational agents can misbehave when they become part of a larger network.

Decision making under uncertainty.

Cognitive biases that emerge when dealing with large risks, and when using the information pipelines used to model catastrophic events.

How to model potential existential risks.

The current project research team are: Anders Sandberg, Stuart Armstrong and Nick Beckstead."

To apply, please complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ryaKFAk_Pr937UopBBLDXDno48MM00vR5s2tOw3KhFo/viewform) by 5pm GMT on August 16th. ]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>ð</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2013-08-06 16:43:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status></item><item><title>How to create the world’s most effective charity</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/162-how-to-create-the-world-s-most-effective-charity</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/102/original/fundraising.png?1362203542'><img alt="Fundraising_for_effective_altruists" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/102/large/fundraising.png?1362203542" /></a>

GiveWell’s charity recommendations – currently [Against Malaria Foundation](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF), [GiveDirectly](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly) and the [Schistosomiasis Control Initiative](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative) – are generally regarded as the most reliable in their field. I imagine many readers here donate to these charities. This makes it all the more surprising that it should be pretty easy to start a charity more effective than any of them.

All you would need to do is found an organisation that fundraises for whoever GiveWell recommends, and raises more than a dollar with each dollar it receives. Is this hard? [Probably](http://80000hours.org/blog/48-fundraising-for-charity-a-career-for-effective-altruists) [not](http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=595). As a general rule, a dollar spent on fundraising seems to raise at least several dollars. It’s a pretty simple and fast multiplier that obviously beats putting your money in the stock market. An independent organisation raising money for GiveWell’s top charities should do *even better* than a typical fundraiser, thanks to:

* the strength of evidence, which is especially compelling to big donors
* the independent recommendation, which looks particularly credible and removes the perception of any ulterior motive
* a willingness to maximise (for example by targeting the wealthy, and focussing on regular or legacy donors)
* an intrinsic motivation to do good
* the freedom to choose which of the three organisations they promote, depending on who they are talking to.

Putting your money into fundraising, rather than just giving it directly, does impose additional costs on the donors you inspire, and may [‘crowd out’](http://80000hours.org/blog/93-why-most-charity-fundraisers-cause-harm) gifts to other charities. However, the logic of giving to GiveWell’s top rated charities is that they make (much) better use of money than most other individuals or organisations. So if you have a fundraising ratio significantly above 1:1, these downsides shouldn’t much matter.

You might ask: if fundraising is the best thing to do, why wouldn’t AMF, SCI or GiveDirectly just spend the money you give them on fundraising? My guess is that it’s simply a bad look. If they spend too much on fundraising, it will irrationally scare off their existing and potential donors. Even if a charity should ideally spend most of its receipts on further fundraising in order to grow more quickly, the option simply isn’t available. The social norm against [‘optimising fundraising‘](http://80000hours.org/blog/92-why-don-t-charities-spend-more-on-fundraising) is generally helpful, because intense competition between charities for donations would cause ‘rent dissipation’, and less total money would flow to charity recipients. But if your charity actually is much better than other charities, and so it’s good when you ‘take’ their money, this social norm does harm by preventing you from doing so.

So, if you are [unlike most donors](http://robertwiblin.com/2012/04/06/the-principle-of-altruistic-arbitrage/) and are willing to have your money spent on effective fundraising, you can easily increase your impact several times over. Just help GiveWell’s top charities take their fundraising efforts ‘off the books’ by founding or giving to a separate organisation that does it for them.

###What Can You Do?

This isn’t actually an impractical plan. Starting up a lean and effective fundraising organisation is difficult, but much easier than building a global team to distribute insecticide-treated bed nets. Any bright and energetic person in a rich country who went and received the necessary training would have a decent shot at getting such an organisation off the ground. 

Here’s some next steps you could take:
* Learn about how to fundraise. For a popular introduction to learning to sell, check out [Influence](http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Business-Essentials/dp/006124189X). For evidence-based advice on raising money for charity, we recommend [The Science of Giving](http://www.amazon.com/Science-Giving-Experimental-Approaches-Judgment/dp/1848728859)
* There are lots of ways to fundraise. Think about which methods might suit you best given your skills and connections. The highest average fundraising ratios are for [legacy fundraising](http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/research/fundratios/), so that’s an intriguing possibility.
* Test it out. See how much you can raise per hour. And how much could this approach be scaled?
* Create a business plan and raise money from effective givers.

If you would like to discuss the first steps required to make this happen, and how you could coordinate with others already taking this approach, including our sister organisation [Giving What We Can](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/), comment below or start a thread on our [discussion forum](http://80000hours.org/discussion).

To do this we need to do two things (at the very least!). First is providing information you can’t get elsewhere about the difference you can make in different career paths. Second is developing a “choosing process”: a way to rationally use this information to make good career decisions. It’s easy to neglect this second part, to think that mere information is enough. But even with all the relevant factual information available, if your judgement is clouded by biases, you won’t make good decisions.

A large and growing body of research [^1], [^2], [^3] suggests that our reasoning processes are far from perfectly “rational.” Over the past few decades, studies have pointed to a number of cognitive biases that affect our decision making in general, and there’s no reason to believe this doesn’t include career decisions. This means that an important part of designing a process for choosing a high impact career has been looking into the extent to which these biases tend to affect peoples’ career decisions, and what can be done about them.

It turns out that we likely don’t know as much as we think we do, and our judgements can often be mistaken in ways that affect our career decisions negatively. Just being aware of this also doesn’t help much. Rather we need to be more sceptical of our decisions than we might be inclined to be, and take a more systematic and evidence-based approach to career choice.

##Our key observations and recommendations

Here I’ll summarise the key points of this post, before going into more depth and outlining the evidence behind each in more detail.

**The main ways in which biases impact on career choice:**

* We think too narrowly about what our options are and how to compare them

* We have a tendency to continue on paths that are no longer beneficial, and resist change even when it’s the best option

* We’re likely to misjudge how likely we are to be successful in different career paths

* In general, we put too much weight on gut judgements, and too little weight on evidence

**The main problems these cause:**

* *People end up in careers where they have less impact than they otherwise could*: missing options that aren’t obvious, neglecting relevant considerations, continuing in low impact paths for long periods of time, and misjudging impact in terms of chances of success and where skills are most useful.

* *People end up in less satisfying careers than they could*: missing plausibly good options, misjudging or missing the factors relevant to satisfaction, and reluctance to leave a job despite it not being enjoyable.

**The best ways for dealing with this**:

* **[Broaden your horizons](http://80000hours.org/blog/141-3-ways-to-broaden-your-career-horizons)** by using a framework for generating ideas, talking to other people and thinking through some reasons what you currently think [might be wrong](http://80000hours.org/blog/154-two-questions-you-won-t-want-to-ask-yourself-but-should)

* **Be systematic**: list the factors relevant to your decision and [try using a formula](http://80000hours.org/blog/117-a-formula-for-the-perfect-job)

* **Learn from mistakes**, but make sure you’re not just staying on a path just because it’s consistent with your previous experience to do so. 

* **Take a more evidence-based approach**: look at [base rates](http://80000hours.org/blog/126-want-to-be-successful-know-your-odds), predictors of [success](http://80000hours.org/blog/132-how-to-judge-your-chances-of-success) and [job satisfaction], try to [estimate](http://80000hours.org/blog/4-estimation-is-the-best-we-have) and [quantify](http://80000hours.org/blog/78-quantification-part-1-an-introduction) the impact of different paths

* I**n general, [question your intuitions](http://80000hours.org/blog/160-when-to-go-with-your-gut-in-career-choice)** and always check them using the above methods

* **Justify your decision to someone else**: ideally to multiple others. We’re [incredibly good at justifying things we want to believe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalization_(making_excuses) to ourselves, but other people are more likely to spot biases and flaws in our arguments. (Although it’s worth noting that if we’re so good at rationalising to ourselves, we may be pretty good at doing so to other people: so whilst this is a helpful tool, it’s not necessarily a foolproof one.)

##Cognitive biases in career choice

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/107/original/narrowmind.png?1362753854'><img alt="Narrowmind" class="image medium" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/107/medium/narrowmind.png?1362753854" /></a>

1) **We often [think too narrowly](http://80000hours.org/blog/141-3-ways-to-broaden-your-career-horizons) when considering what options are available to us, and what’s important in comparing them.**

*What’s the evidence for this?*

There’s evidence that in decision making, we “narrow frame” in two ways: first, we think too narrowly about what options are available to us. Second, we think too narrowly about what our objectives are in comparing those options.[^4] This is supported both by direct studies, and by the existence of more general biases: the [availability heuristic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic), causing us to focus on options that are readily available; [anchoring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring), a tendency to overweight the first piece of information given; [status quo bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias), an irrational preference for the current state of affairs, and the [sunk cost fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost_fallacy#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy), the tendency to assign more weight to options we’ve already invested time and effort into.

*Why is it a problem for careers?*

If you don’t consider all your options, how can you be sure you’ve chosen the best one? If people consistently fail to think through all the opportunities available to them, it seems highly plausible that many could be in better suited and higher impact careers than they are currently.

As explained above, it’s not just about missing options: it’s about how you compare them. If you neglect an important consideration when comparing options, you might end up favouring the wrong one for the wrong reasons. There’s risk of a compound effect here: first thinking too narrowly about what options are available to you, and then on top of this thinking too narrowly about how to evaluate this already limited set of options, your chances of choosing a suboptimal career are greatly increased.

*What can you do about it?*

Take some time to [broaden your horizons](http://80000hours.org/blog/141-3-ways-to-broaden-your-career-horizons). Using a framework  such as our 5 types of career (or even better, multiple different frameworks) to generate options early on will help ensure you consider a wide range of alternatives. Widen your perspective by talking to and comparing options with other people: the more diverse the range of people you consult, the better. As well as thinking through the pros of each of your options, think too about why they might not be so great: [what are some reasons you might be wrong](http://80000hours.org/blog/154-two-questions-you-won-t-want-to-ask-yourself-but-should) about this option?

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/106/original/60-wrong-way-610x457.jpg?1362753807'><img alt="60-wrong-way-610x457" class="image medium" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/106/medium/60-wrong-way-610x457.jpg?1362753807" /></a>

2) **We often continue on paths or in careers for too long when it would actually be more beneficial to change.**

*What’s the evidence for this?*

A bias known as the [sunk cost fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy): a tendency to continue doing something that’s no longer beneficial simply because we’ve already invested a lot of time or money in it.[^5] This is irrational because the time or money is already spent, and therefore irrelevant to the decision you’re now making: they are [sunk costs.](http://80000hours.org/blog/107-good-generals-let-their-soldiers-die-in-vain) 

*Why is it a problem for careers?*

Suppose you’ve spent years working and studying to get a dream job, only to realise you could be doing something completely different that would have much more impact. The thought of abandoning all those years’ effort is hard, right? It’s tempting to continue with what you’ve already invested in, hoping things will improve. But you can’t get the years you’ve spent already back: and by continuing you’re probably just wasting more. Abandoning sunk costs in your career can be incredibly difficult, but it’s important if you want to make as much difference as possible. You need to be able to identify when your preference for a certain career is for good reason, and when it’s just because of past commitments.

*What can you do about it?*

The bad news is that it doesn’t seem like simply knowing about the sunk cost fallacy, thinking hard about it, or talking it over with people, will help very much. The good news, though, is that [sunk costs can be fought](http://80000hours.org/blog/111-sunk-costs-in-careers) if you try hard enough and think about your decisions in the right way:

* *Ignore the past*: think about where you are now, the qualifications and experience you have, as if they just appeared from nowhere.

* *Think about the future*: make a list of the pros and cons of each of your alternatives *from now own.*

* *Justify your decision to someone else*: it’s much harder to justify biased decisions to someone else!

3) **We’re likely to misjudge our chances of success in different career paths**

*What’s the evidence for this?*

When judging our chances of success, we tend to use something called the [representativeness heuristic]: asking “how much do I *seem* like the sort of person who would be successful in this field?” The problem with this approach is that, no matter how much you look like the kind of person who would be successful, if the chances of *anyone* succeeding in your field are low, you’ll likely be overestimating your chances. This is known as base rate neglect: neglecting to consider the underlying probabilities or base rates. No matter how much you *seem* like the sort of person who would single-handedly find a cure for cancer, your chances of doing so are minute simply because the chances of *anyone* doing so are so small. 

There’s also evidence from studies that we tend to be overconfident in general: most people think they’re better than average, and underestimate the time it will take them to complete a given task.

*Why is it a problem for careers?*

Being successful in whatever you do is obviously crucial to making an impact. The existence of base rate neglect plus overconfidence suggest that we’re likely to overestimate our chances of finding a cure for malaria, becoming head of the world’s most cost-effective charity, or completely revolutionising academic incentives, to give a few examples. But this doesn’t mean that no-one should do these things.[^6] What we need is to be able to accurately judge our chances of success: aiming high, but not too high. 

*What can you do about it?*

The suggested approach should help you judge your chances of success in a given field or career:

1. Work out which factors (personality traits, skills and abilities) are most relevant to success in the field you’re considering
2. Find ways to objectively measure yourself on these factors
3. Given this information, narrow down your reference class to those similar to you

4) **Although conventional wisdom emphasises the importance of “going with your gut” in career decisions, [we should be sceptical of at least some of our intuitive judgements](http://80000hours.org/blog/160-when-to-go-with-your-gut-in-career-choice).**

*What’s the evidence for this?*

There’s a large body of research that’s emerged over the past couple of centuries in what’s now known as the “heuristics and biases” tradition, investigating the shortcuts ([heuristics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic)) that underlie our intuitive judgements and how they can go awry (resulting in [biases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias).) Most gut judgements are based on [rules of thumb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb), which when applied in the majority of situations allow us to make surprisingly accurate judgements with little time and effort. However, when we apply these shortcuts blindly, they can [sometimes go wrong](http://80000hours.org/blog/109-should-we-stop-interviewing-people). This is a well established phenomenon across a variety of situations, so it seems pretty likely to impact our career decisions. Research also suggests that intuitions are most likely to lead us astray when we’re less experienced, the situation in which we’re making decisions is highly unpredictable, and we don’t get good feedback on our choices. [Career choice arguably fits all three of these criteria most of the time.](http://80000hours.org/blog/160-when-to-go-with-your-gut-in-career-choice)

*Why is it a problem for careers?*

The key point here is that if we let gut judgements guide our decisions without questioning their basis, we’re operating somewhat blindly. If we don’t know what shortcuts underlie our judgements, then we can’t be sure what factors are guiding our decisions. For any big career decision, there will be a number of different important factors to consider, and it’s highly unlikely that the rules of thumb we use implicitly will manage to incorporate them all. This means if you just “go with your gut”, it’s pretty likely you’ll be missing some important considerations, which in turn means your decision might not be as good as it could be. If you want to be sure you’ve chosen the career where you can have the most impact, the career you’ll enjoy the most, or the career where you’ll be most successful (or like most of us - all three!) you need to make sure you go through all the relevant considerations. Your “gut” can’t do this (at least, not all of the time.)

*What can you do about it?*

Double-check your intuitions against more systematic methods and by getting more evidence. You might, for example, try explicitly listing all the factors that are important for your decision, and then attempt to score different options on these factors and compare them. Even if you don’t necessarily use this to determine your decision, it will likely highlight some factors that your first impressions miss, and flag the areas where you need to get more information.

</br>
At 80,000 Hours, [we think it’s really important to find](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2XNfeIASoA) the [causes](/causes) in which you can make the most difference. One important consideration in evaluating causes is how much we should care about their impact on future generations. [Important new research](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxuYmVja3N0ZWFkfGd4OjM4ZDVlYjY4ZTkzMzFlZjE) by a trustee of [CEA](http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/) (our parent charity) [Nick Beckstead](http://80000hours.org/members/nick-beckstead), argues that the impact on the long-term direction of civilization is likely to be the most important consideration in working out the importance of a cause. 

**Briefly**: Barring a disaster, the Earth will remain habitable for about a billion years, and many millions of future generations could come after us. Most of humanity’s potential lies in the future. There are actions we might take today that could have a significant impact on these future generations. For instance, if we cause a nuclear war that ends civilization, then this future will never happen at all. **So, from the perspective of making a difference,  the expected impact of our actions today on the far future might be the most important thing about them.**

<p> </p>
</br>

In the rest of this post, we summarise the argument and its consequences, concluding:

* The argument seems plausible, so it’s plausible that the expected impact of different causes on future civilization is the most important thing about them.
* We know little about the effects of different causes on the long term future
* Thus, if the argument is plausible, it’s very unclear which cause is most effective
* Since prioritization research that considers the far future is also extremely neglected, we think the argument implies it’s highly important to invest more in research to prioritise among causes (which we argue in a future post)
* We’ll also outline in a future post our current best guesses at how best to help the far future


##Why is the far future important?
</br>
Here’s the argument stated more formally:

1. The future of civilization might be extremely long, which means its value might be extremely great (in comparison with the present)

2. Some of our actions today could shape the path that civilization takes in not-ridiculously-small ways

3. Due to (1), the importance of long-term changes to the path of civilization outweigh merely short term changes

4. So, from the perspective of making a difference, what matters most about our actions today is their effect on the general path that civilization takes

Let’s go over these points, starting with (1). If civilization isn’t ended by a disaster, how long could it go on for? Our best estimates from astronomy say that the Earth will remain habitable for around a billion years. In addition, it’s likely there are other planets that will last much longer. If our descendants can ever colonize these planets, then civilization could last hundreds of trillions of years. Our civilization has only lasted several thousand years so far, so its future potential is vastly larger than our history to date.

Whether we ever fulfill this potential is extremely uncertain, but we think its value would be so great that it’s worth caring about even if there’s only a small chance of it coming about.

Imagine an asteroid hit the Earth in Roman times and ended civilization. In Roman times, there were around 100 million people living on the Earth. How bad would that event have been? It seems to us that the impact would have been much worse than 100 million deaths. It would have also included the loss of two thousand years of civilization from then until today, and probably beyond. Similarly, if civilization ended today, the cost wouldn’t just be 7 billion deaths, but it would also be the chance of an extremely long and flourishing future, and we think that would be really bad. So, we think the far future matters.

This is in part a value judgement, which people can reasonably disagree about (see some of the responses in the next section.) On balance, however, we think the reasons in favor of caring about future generations outweigh those against.

Looking now at (2), our actions can have consequences that ripple forward and change this future. I’ve already mentioned one trivial example. If we caused a disaster that ended civilization today, then this future would never happen. But there are other ways we might shape the future. For instance, if we pass down certain values to our descendants, then it might move civilization onto a slightly better path, which could alter what happens to our descendants over millions, billions or trillions of years.

The value of actions that ripple forward is likely to be many, many times larger than the value of actions that only affect the present. This comes out more clearly if we look at some very rough numbers. If there’s a 1% chance humanity survives the next billion years, and a 1% chance of then colonizing other planets, we can expect civilization to last for 10 billion years (and this seems conservative). One way we can change the path of future civilization is by reducing the risk of the end of civilization. There seems to be some actions we can take today that would reduce this risk by more than a 1 in a million chance; for instance, tracking more asteroids, improving disease surveillance programs, reducing greenhouse emissions and strengthening global governance. If that’s true, then the expected value of these actions is adding an expected 10,000 years to civilization. We think 10,000 years of future civilization is worth far more than even very large improvements over the next couple of decades. So, this example of a path change matters much more than the realistic near term impacts of our actions.


###Why might this argument fail?
</br>
There are plenty of ways to reject this argument. First, a clarification. The argument only concerns what we should do *insofar as we care about making a difference.* Other factors can matter morally. For instance, we might think that we have a greater obligation to present generations than future generations. I think, however, that everyone should care about making a difference to some extent. As Rawls said, “All ethical doctrines worth our attention take consequences into account in judging rightness.” And since in this case the stakes are so high - there’s a potentially huge future ahead - what happens to the far future should matter whatever your general moral beliefs.

In addition, you can object in three ways:
1. Morally, we can’t do good to people who don’t exist yet - this is called the ‘person-affecting view’ in moral philosophy.
2. People in the future matter much less
3. Theoretical objections to the formalisation of the argument - for instance, you can point out that it looks a bit similar to [Pascal’s mugging](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Pascal's_mugging) and argue that accepting this way of reasoning leads to paradox.

You can find responses to these arguments from Chapter 3 onwards in the [thesis](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxuYmVja3N0ZWFkfGd4OjM4ZDVlYjY4ZTkzMzFlZjE), which we think are reasonably compelling.

Another response is that the conclusion seems very unintuitive. How could the morally right thing to do be so weird? This makes us cautious in accepting the argument, since we normally seek to bring our views in line with [what informed experts would say about the issue](http://lesswrong.com/r/lesswrong/lw/iao/common_sense_as_a_prior/). Nevertheless, in this case there are some explanations for why common sense might be wrong, as explored in the [second chapter of the thesis](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxuYmVja3N0ZWFkfGd4OjM4ZDVlYjY4ZTkzMzFlZjE).

Finally, note that we don’t have to *certain* that this argument is valid in order for it to matter a great deal. Both Nick and we are uncertain that the argument holds, but because if it does hold it’s extremely important, [even if we just think there’s a small chance that it holds](http://80000hours.org/blog/19-practical-ethics-given-moral-uncertainty), it still matters.

###What about speed-ups?
</br>
There’s an important type of near-term benefit that is useful to treat separately from the others, which slightly complicates the situation. Our actions can also speed-up civilization's progress along a path. In total, this gives us three ways to categorise the effects of actions:

1. Near term benefits
2. Speed-ups - increasing the rate at which we move along a path
3. Path changes - the extent to which the action puts the future of civilization on a different path. These sub-divide into broad and targeted ways to cause path changes.

We think that speed-ups are likely to matter far less than path changes. If everything is speeded up at the same rate, the impact consists of bringing forward future civilization. However, it seems very hard to advance progress by more than a couple of decades. So, the value of these speed-ups is normally going to be much less than the value of improving the path of future civilization, which we have shown could plausibly have a value of over tens of thousands of years of future civilization. This is also covered in more detail in the thesis.

Note that in practice most speed-ups to general development are also likely to cause path changes. For instance, increasing economic development could cause a path change because it might increase (or decrease) the chance of developing a dangerous technology faster (or slower) than our ability to mitigate the risks of technology. A *mere* speed-up is relatively unimportant, but in practice speed-ups could cause important path changes.


##What does this mean for people looking to make a difference?
</br>
###What about our current attempts to do good?

The argument implies that path changes matter far more than the near term benefits of our actions. If the argument holds, what does this imply about our current attempts to do good?

Most attempts at making a difference today seem to be aimed at having near term benefits. If the effect of our actions on the far future is what matters most, then our current attempts might be misguided.

On the other hand, near term benefits have [ripple effects](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/) that could cause path changes. For instance, if you save a child of malaria, then that child has a chance to receive an education and work, which helps the community, who have further descendants, who might contribute to broader progress and so on.

Nick makes a helpful distinction between *broad* and *targeted* ways of trying to improve the future. Broad interventions are things like improving education. They improve our general capacity to deal with future problems. Targeted interventions involve working on specific risks to the future, e.g. trying to reduce the risk of an asteroid strike. In between lies a spectrum. An intervention in the middle could be something like ‘teach our children to be good stewards of the future.’ Broad interventions are promising because they don’t depend on the details of what happens in the future, which are highly unpredictable. Targeted interventions are promising because they are more focused and often more neglected.

If the best ways to help the future turn out to be *broad*, then our current attempts at making a difference, which are often focused on near term benefits which have positive ripple effects, might turn out to be pretty good. In this way, common sense beliefs about the best ways to do good could turn out to be largely right, even if the reasons behind them were wrong. On the other hand, even if this turns out to be true, there would likely still be room for improvement to common sense ways to doing good. This is because some interventions with large near term benefits will likely have much stronger ripple effects than others, it seems like it might be possible to identify these, and very little effort has been put into identifying them so far.

On the other hand, if the best interventions turn out to be relatively *targeted*, then our current attempts at doing good are likely to be highly sub-optimal.


###What should we do going forward?

Some in the effective altruism community have previously thought that targeted interventions are likely to be best at helping the far future, in particular interventions that aim to directly reduce the risk of extinction. This position has been advanced by [Nick Bostrom](http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.html) and [MIRI](http://intelligence.org/).

In this new research, Nick (Beckstead) points out that Bostrom never argues that reducing the risk of extinction is more important than other forms of path change i.e. making the whole of the future a little bit better. Which is better is currently unsettled. If we care about all types of path change, then it becomes pretty unclear whether targeted interventions are better than broad. Moreover, very little work has been done on this question. (See a summary of this argument [here](http://effective-altruism.com/proposed-adjustment-astronomical-waste-argument))

Our take on the situation is that since the degree of uncertainty is very large, there’s a huge amount at stake. Since very little work has been done on these questions, **the most important thing to do now is more prioritisation research**. This research would examine (i) whether the argument for focusing on the far future is correct (ii) if it is, then what are the best ways to help the far future? Even without the far future consideration, we think further prioritisation research is highly important, so this extra consideration just adds to the case. 80,000 Hours is preparing a report on why we think prioritisation is one of the most important causes.

In terms of our own research, we want to investigate how people can best contribute to prioritisation research in their careers. For evaluating other causes, we’ll aim to identify causes that seem plausibly good for the far future and look good by ordinary standards, and flag both, then leave it up to our members to decide how much weight they want to put on the far future.

If forced to guess now, what look like the best ways to help the far future? We’re also preparing a report on that, which will be out shortly.

**Composition of Membership**

* The average age of our new members is 26.9 years. This has risen significantly from 23, since the press coverage and online outreach brought in new members from outside the effective altruist or university communities.

* 35% of our total members are women, and 65% are men. In the last 6 months, 38% of new members were women, and 62% of new members were men. In the previous 6 months, 38% of new members were women, and 62% of new members were men.

* 11% of members are from Oxford. This has substantially decreased from about 25%, since the press coverage and online outreach mainly brought in members from outside of Oxford.

**Causes and Declarations of Intent**

The table below reports data on the declarations of intent to donate by the overall 80,000 Hours membership, as well as the members who joined in the last 6 months and the previous 6 months.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">

At this point, 19% of members report interest in improving health to address global poverty, 13% in ending factory farming, and 9% in reducing the risk of human extinction.

**Careers Advising**

We gave over 44 one-on-one advice sessions, compared to 43 in the previous period. In the previous period, we spoke to the majority of people who requested coaching. In this period, however, we received about 150 requests, so only talked to about 1 in 3 of the people who made requests. In addition, we interviewed 15 people one-on-one about their career planning problems.

Feedback on our coaching has been generally strong over the last year, especially in more recent times as we have been more selective with requests. In our follow up survey to coachees (completed by 56 of 95), coachees gave the following ratings:

*How useful was the coaching session?*

This report outlines our key priorities for the next six months.

## Summary and Discussion
</br>
* We continue to see the top priority as further investment i.e. developing our business model, content and the organisation’s robustness.

* The flagship goal in this area is carrying out 30 case studies, which will form the centre of our content and evaluation efforts.

* Also important is: (i) more impact evaluation in general (ii) fundraising enough to keep up with our expanding budget (iii) increasing our talent pool through training and outreach (iv) increase the appeal of our content to successful young professionals through rebranding (v) having high quality research on our key ideas to support the case studies on our blog.

* Outreach is less high priority, except insofar as we do enough to ensure a strong stream of candidates for case studies and internships, and build up credibility (e.g. receiving press coverage and impressive affiliations).

* We’re also not yet focused on scaling up delivery, because we think it will be overall faster to spend more time developing our content at this stage.

## Our Priorities
</br>
*Case Studies*

* Carry out and evaluate the impact of 30 high-quality case studies with people who have high potential to make a difference.

*Evaluation*

*  Improve our data collection and storage, in particular, setting up a central CRM database.

* Aim to be in a position to carry out and analyse an impact survey of members before the end of the first quarter of 2014. This is in order to improve our evaluation of to what extent our online content causes career or donation changes.

* Perform an evaluation of our research to date.

* Update our understanding of customer problems and our target market based on recent user data.

* Use all of this information to improve our business strategy.

*Fundraising*

* Fundraise an additional £150,000 by the end of the first quarter of 2014 so that we have 12 months of reserves by the end of the period.

* Experiment with at least one alternative fundraising model.

*Professionalising our brand*

* Adapt our marketing to appeal more to successful young professionals rather than students, increase our credibility and update on our improved understanding of our target market. This will include the following sub-priorities:

    (i) Rebrand our visual identity, including the updating the website design

    (ii) Update our key online copy

    (iii) Alter how we pitch 80,000 Hours

    (iv) Seek to build up more ways to prove credibility e.g. (a) start applying for Matrix accreditation (or similar) and (b) post-our self-evaluations.

* Improve our marketing towards new staff by articulating why to work at 80,000 Hours and improving our communication of what we do.

*Content (over and above case studies)*

* Complete high quality content explaining our core frameworks and best guesses for Our Findings page.

*Other organisation building*

* Hire another full-time staff member of the careers research team, increasing the team to 4 full-time staff, and hire at least five long-term interns, to maintain our target of at least 6 interns (counting 80,000 Hours front facing interns and 50% of CEA ops interns). We want to maintain the ability of these staff at least at current levels, which will require better promotion of ourselves as a job opportunity.

* Increase the independence of central CEA by creating the ED of CEA role.

* Increase transparency about our plans and their justification by posting our evaluations and the story of our research process on the blog.

*Promotion*

* Reach out to high potential networks to ensure we have a strong enough supply of case study candidates and interns.

* Run a promotional push to ‘launch’ our new content in October, with the aim of finding strong case study and staff candidates.

* Receive press coverage for the organisation and our best content.

* Coach our student group leaders to run successful outreach programs in our university hubs.

* Continue to take low time outreach activities e.g. posting to social media, SEO and Adwords.

 

## How will we carry out the case studies?
</br>
What follows is our tentative initial guess of how to run the case studies.

*The process*

* We start with an initial exploratory session which is 1-2 hours, in which we gather information and decide the next best step to resolve uncertainty (this might be defining a research question which we then spend some time on, but it might also be for them to go and get more information about a specific area by speaking to people, or something else).

* We then meet for a second time to present and discuss our findings, and decide on the next best step.

* We iterate this process a number of times, depending on the length of each iteration and what's helpful, but us spending no more than ~4 days research total.

* We have a final meeting to discuss findings and conclusions etc.

* We write up the most important and generalisable parts for the blog.

*How do we select the people?*

Our goal is to pick the people who will get the most out of our service.

We think this means looking for the following traits:

1. Overall excellence: Is there evidence that we can expect them to be high achieving in the future?

2. Cause neutrality: Are they happy to consider a wide range of ways to make a difference and decide based on evidence?

3. Altruism: How motivated are they to do whatever has most impact?

4. Good questions: How well do their questions match our research question criteria 3 and 4 below?

Right now, this typically means we talk to motivated graduates of elite universities, with a variety of high potential options, who are familiar with the ideas of effective altruism and care strongly about positive impact.

We select research questions based on:

1. Decision relevance to the individual: concerns a question that could swing the balance of their career decision

2. Tractability: extent to which it is easy for us to say something decisive about this question in our research time

3. High impact options: relevance to the causes and careers that we think are high priority

4. Generalizability: extent to which the question is relevant to other members

*What data will we collect for evaluation?*

* Before or after the first meeting, we’ll collect their current career plan, broken down into their options for (i) cause (ii) mission (iii) next steps with subjective probabilities.

* We take notes of all the meetings and our research recommendations. We can use this to track what new information we presented them with.

* We collect an exit career plan at the end of the last meeting. We can use this to track how the process changed their plans.

* We follow up to see how they acted on this plan.

* In addition, for the purposes of research evaluation, we track (i) the number of hours we spend doing research, sources used and methods used (ii) we normally speak to coachees in pairs so that the second person can give feedback to the lead (iii) we plan to record most coaching sessions so that we can get further feedback.

## How did we take account of the recommendations of the trustee performance evaluation?
</br>
Nick recommended the following measures:

1. Obtain a stronger understanding of how we change career plans.

2. Provide stronger evidence that we’re changing career plans and that these changes are improvements.

3. Integrate our data collection into a single database.

4. Increase the standardisation of our data collection.

We are acting on all of these recommendations in this plan. (1) and (2) are addressed primarily through the case study model, though we also plan to survey our other members within the next 12 months. In addition, we’ll address (2) by adding a research evaluation to our next six month review. (3) is addressed via setting up a CRM. This will also help (4), though it will be difficult to improve this dramatically in the short term as we continue to rapidly adjust our monitoring and evaluation processes.

## What are our long-term plans?
</br>
For more detail of our business model and long-term vision, see our [Business Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aMkbpGDzSbugqvl3CQaDU5YSSEa2SE8JUGM9_fzvOdE/edit) document.

In this report, we answer a set of critical questions for 80,000 Hours stakeholders. These questions are inspired by [GiveWell’s self-evaluation process](http://www.givewell.org/about/self-evaluation), but also include further questions that we think are important for 80,000 Hours, including several we have been asked by our stakeholders.

 

## Summary
</br>
* We believe it’s likely but highly uncertain that our current business model and content is cost-effective relative to GiveWell’s top recommendations, and we continue to rapidly improve our business model.

* We continue to learn about how to function effectively as an organisation (as evident in [Our Progress](http://80000hours.org/blog/246-our-progress-dec-2012-may-2013)). One significant challenge ahead is learning how to effectively run a larger, three tier organisation.

* We continue to rely heavily on our key staff, though we’re making progress towards reducing this reliance.

* We’re not financially weak, but there is significant room to become more secure.

* Our team is highly able and reports high levels of satisfaction, and we’re attracting very talented applicants, especially to our internships. Nevertheless, we are being somewhat slowed down by not being able to find enough talented staff.

 

## How well is our current business model working?
</br>
This is evaluated in Nick Beckstead’s separate [performance evaluation of 80,000 Hours](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8OdBVMpAjJHQWJEZC1QeFhIYnc/edit). I think the main conclusions are:

* We’re successful in our aims to engage people in our programs.

*  My best guess is that we’re yielding a good return on our costs at the margin through raising donations to cost-effective charities (which we do via promoting Earning to Give). Our marginal cost per member seems to be under a thousand dollars. It seems likely (but with high uncertainty) that the counterfactually-adjusted, future, time-discounted donations raised per new member is well above this figure.

* There is good evidence that people gain new information from our career coaching and find it useful.

* We only have patchy, anecdotal evidence about how we change career plans, which may demonstrate proof of concept but is not strong enough to conclude our model is effectively changing careers. We need to focus on gathering more data about this.

* We also need to develop a process for evaluating the quality of our recommendations.

 

We made two rounds of improvements to our strategy, as listed in [Our Progress](http://80000hours.org/blog/246-our-progress-dec-2012-may-2013).

### How successful are we in improving our business model?
</br>
I think the two significant updates we’ve made to our content strategy (as explained in [Our Progress](http://80000hours.org/blog/246-our-progress-dec-2012-may-2013)) in the period show that we remain very flexible in response to the evidence and new ideas. We believe these changes were improvements due to the reasons listed.

Moreover, we expect them to continue to improve because we think we have a good planning process. First, we prioritise tracking our performance at every level. Second, we have a variety of ways to keep the team in sync about our performance, including short daily meetings, regular open strategy discussions, weekly impact reports and team meetings to discuss other issues. Third, we cultivate a candid culture by encouraging feedback. Fourth, we build the team with people who have the insight and inclination to help us improve. Fifth, we have a large number of advisors who we respect, and we seek out their feedback on our plans and performance (including the trustees of CEA and the 80,000 Hours Advisory Board, who formally review our six month reviews). As an example, in this period Nick Beckstead performed an evaluation of our impact to date, in which he made several recommendations that were incorporated into our team plans.

*How can we improve?*

 

The main weakness seems to have been not having enough experienced, full-time management capacity devoted to improving the business model. We’re dealing with this as quickly as we can by (i) hiring new staff (ii) training existing staff into manager positions. We would also like to seek more experienced people to act as mentors or to join our advisory board.

We may also be able to improve by sharing our plans even more widely in order to get more feedback and encourage an even greater culture of transparency. We plan to start doing this by releasing this review to the blog and improving our tracking of key metrics.

## How good are our recommendations about which career opportunities have the most impact?
</br>
We’ve decided to delay this evaluation until we have a larger body of research. I plan to include it in the next review.

## Do we justify our costs?
</br>
I think we can investigate a lower bound by estimating the donations we raise for the best charities. Our current best expected value estimate, primarily based on a [trustee evaluation](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8OdBVMpAjJHQWJEZC1QeFhIYnc/edit),  is that the 400 members we recruited over this period will result in future, time-discounted, counterfactually adjusted donations to top charities of $4.4mn (range $0.28mn - $68mn). This would place our cost-effectiveness ratio on the basis of donations on the order of 40x GiveWell’s top recommendations (range 2x to 570x).

Note that this estimate has not been reverted to the prior, so if you’re sceptical that the kind of thing 80,000 Hours does will be high impact, then you should use a significantly lower estimate for practical purposes. Note, however, that you would need to revert by two orders of magnitude for us to become less cost-effective than GiveWell's top recommendations. My impression is that this is pessimistic, since I think that it’s relatively easy to raise more than 1x your costs through fundraising, but there is considerable room for debate and I do not rest my case for our effectiveness of this figure.

Rather, it would be highly unfair to focus on this figure for evaluating our effectiveness, since we think the main benefits of our current activities are: (i) gaining valuable information (ii) investing in future outreach.

To expand on (i), I think it’s likely there exists an extremely high impact model in our area, so exploring this space has very high value. The key question for evaluating our effectiveness, therefore, is "are we effectively exploring this space?" I think we are currently making good progress in exploring this space, as shown by the rapid improvements to our business model listed in [Our Progress](http://80000hours.org/blog/246-our-progress-dec-2012-may-2013). I expect this to continue so long as we remain committed to monitoring our impact and open to the evidence. 

Moreover, we have done this with relatively low costs. We have operated with a team of about 7.5 full-time workers for under £100,000 annually. Our team are usually highly motivated, high performing people in their mid-twenties, so I think this represents exceptional value. Our full-time staff receive below market rate wages even compared to non-profits, and could have earned several times as much in the corporate sector. Moreover, each has thought carefully, often for months, about whether 80,000 Hours represents the career opportunity with the highest expected impact for them.

This estimate also doesn’t include activities like creating and spinning off Effective Animal Activism.

 

## How well is 80,000 Hours run?
</br>
### Can 80,000 Hours be continued without relying on its head staff?
</br>
*Where we stood in November 2012*

I was personally managing the entire team and we relied almost entirely on Will for fundraising.

 

*Progress since then*

We developed a clearer business model and became more solidified in our plans, which would make it easier to replace me. We increased our full-time management capacity to two people after Niel was hired in January 2012. We made progress in developing new leaders for the organisation.

 

On the recommendation of the last advisory board, we continue to improve the ways of transferring knowledge within the team, again reducing the reliance on myself.

 

We plan to hand fundraising over to Niel in September and a trainee intern, with support from me. This will reduce our reliance on Will for fundraising.

 

*What we can do to improve*

 

Continue to develop our model, and to train and attract new talented leaders.

 

### Is our team effective, motivated and well managed?
</br>
*Where we stood in November 2012*

 

* Team satisfaction was high. The main dissatisfactions concerned (i) the poor office (ii) not enough training (iii) atmosphere not professional enough.

* The team was highly able. Productivity was high but I thought we could develop more motivation, excitement and focus among the team with a better plan.

* After a round of improvements in the previous period, we had good processes for line managing and giving feedback.

 

*Progress since November 2012*

* Team satisfaction remains high and we’ve taken steps to address the dissatisfactions (see [Our Progress](http://80000hours.org/blog/246-our-progress-dec-2012-may-2013)). We also received feedback asking for greater transparency concerning strategy, which has been acted on.

* The team remains highly able, especially at the top end, though average ability might have slightly reduced as we’ve grown. The case study model is easier to communicate and seems to have increased motivation.

* I’ve continued to learn about how to be a good manager based on feedback from my team, and learning about specific skills (e.g. coaching).

 

*What we can do to improve*

The main area to focus on going forward is learning to manage a three tier team. Managing managers involves different skills to managing people doing direct work. We also need to work more on maintaining a strong organisational culture and good communication of our vision.

 

In particular, we need to focus on developing an effective role for the shared operations team. Niel will be addressing this as ED of CEA from September.

 

### Can we attract enough talent to meet our growth plans?
</br>
The recruitment process in this period revealed that we couldn’t find anyone willing to work for us who we were comfortable with hiring immediately. We’ve also moved Niel and Rob into central CEA, losing two potential staff members for core 80,000 Hours work. This raises the worry that we’re being slowed down by a lack of talented staff.

 

We have space for about two staff members to join the team almost immediately – a replacement for Jess or Roman, and another person. Unless the next recruitment round is more successful than the last, it’s unlikely we can fill both of these spaces for at least six months (the time to hire new people then trial and train them as interns). Therefore, lack of talent seems to be delaying our team growth by ~6 months.

 

### Is gender balance a problem?
</br>
Members of 80,000 Hours are only 35% women, and the proportion within the team has mostly been even lower than this. I think this is a problem because it suggests that we’re not appealing to women, the team is less diverse, and it’s difficult to reverse (since a male heavy team seems to attract more men).

 

I think the reason for the imbalance is at least in part the feedback loop that a male heavy community tends to appeal to other males. This means it can be altered by improving how the community appears by encouraging women to take more public facing roles. In the last six months, new members have been 38% women, a slight shift in the right direction, but not nearly good enough.

*What can we do to improve?*

Continue to seek out women leaders. Write more content about careers that have a higher proportion of women, rather than our historical focus on earning to give via tech and finance.

 

### Is our use of interns effective?
</br>
*Should we have hired more full-time staff rather than interns?*

In terms of compensation and operations time, interns cost less than 50% of full-time staff. In most cases, they seem just as able as the people we could have otherwise hired at the margin. In fact, in our last recruitment round, our top intern applicant ranked higher than the top person who was only willing to become staff. This 50% cost saving seems worth incurring the training time loss from higher turn-over.

 

Besides immediate costs, there are two other considerations in favor of maintaining a higher ratio of interns to staff relative to what’s immediately operationally efficient. First, it has been difficult to find people we’re confident in hiring immediately. Rather than rush into hiring, which can be difficult to reverse, I prefer to get by with interns and then hire later as we find more people.

 

Second, our training of interns creates wider benefits for us and supports our ultimate cause of promoting effective altruism. Having lots of good people in Oxford is turning us into a hub for effective altruism. Our talent pool has attracted the interest of two potential corporate sponsors. Many former interns continue to promote or fund 80,000 Hours, run spin-offs and pursue high impact careers in part aided by their time with us.

 

Overall, I think it was the right decision to have a particularly high ratio of interns to staff so far, and expect the ratio to remain higher than many comparable organisations in the future. The main mistake was in execution: we could have reduced the training loss costs of interns by encouraging more people to take 8-10 month placements.

 

*Should we have kept the team smaller?*

 

We have, however, had a slight problem with our staff spending too much time on management and not enough time on strategy and content, which seems to have slightly slowed down our long-term impact in favour of more immediate impact. I don’t think this problem was caused by hiring interns instead of staff, rather it was caused by letting the overall team grow slightly too large.

 

I’m monitoring this issue more closely in the future, and already slightly reduced the size of our team this summer after becoming aware of this mistake.

 

*Conclusion*

I think our heavy use of interns relative to staff was the right decision, but in the future we should (i) attempt to hire more long term interns (ii) control team growth so that we don’t overburden the long-term staff with management duties. In the future, I expect the ratio of interns to staff will decrease from 2-3:1 down to 1-2:1, as we find more people we are comfortable with hiring.

 

### Are we operationally efficient?
</br>
We’ve built a team of people who are smart, motivated and believe in the project, at the cost of having less experience. I think this was the right decision, but it means we need to learn rapidly as we go about how to build an organisation. As the mistakes section shows, this has led to some problems, though I don’t think they have been serious.

 

We’re starting to address this weakness partly by gaining experience, improving monitoring, and by starting to hire more experienced people.

 

### Do we live up to our team values?
</br>
I think the main weakness is that **our culture doesn’t always appear professional enough**. We’ve given a bad impression to several interns and third parties, which has made it harder to retain staff and deal with these parties.

 

One cause has been having a bad office. This happened due to delays far beyond expectations with the FHI office. Another cause has been having a large number of interns, who tend to feel less like professional staff and turn over quickly. I think the decision to hire these interns was not a mistake at the time – it allowed us to expand much faster given our budget and there were not enough people we were willing to hire full-time.

 

Going forward, we plan to (i) move into a better office as soon as possible and emphasise developing a good office culture (ii) hire longer term interns (iii) keep increasing the number of full-time staff, especially in operations (iv) work more on fostering the value of professionalism in the team.

 

We also had feedback on not enough transparency, which we’ve addressed (as explained in [Our Progress](http://80000hours.org/blog/246-our-progress-dec-2012-may-2013)).

 

 

### Are we financially robust?
</br>
*What’s the situation now?*

 

Fundraising has generally gone well and we continue to build up a strong base of donors. Over the period, we have generally been able to cover our budget more than four months in advance. We’ve also started to build up some partners who have offered to help us in emergencies and we’ve developed better tracking of our financial situation.

 

*How can we improve?*

 

Besides continuing to build our donor base, we can increase security further by building more reserves. Currently, our reserves are low at only two months, in part due to having a lumpy annual income stream and in part due to not enough investment in fundraising. Our target is to reach six months (see our upcoming finance report). We believe we can make this target over the next budget period by investing more time in fundraising. In the short-term, we will seek to move some donations forward.

We believe we can further improve the monitoring of our financial situation by producing monthly income reports and improving the usability of our budgets. Creating the ED of CEA position should also help to increase the coordination and management of the people involved in finance.

 

After this, we will pursue greater diversity of funding sources. First, we will increase our fundraising from grants and foundations, then we will start to re-investigate various forms of corporate sponsorship. Second, we will consider various ways to charge for careers advice.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>ø</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2013-08-31 10:27:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status></item><item><title>Career Advice for High-Impact Activism</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/148-career-advice-for-high-impact-activism</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[*Nick Cooney is the Founder and Director of The Humane League –

impact with your career.*

*Please note that this does not represent the views of Farm Sanctuary.*

<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/joiseyshowaa/1400175456/'><img alt="Tree" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/84/large/tree.jpg?1359467591" /></a>

So you want to do the most good you can in life. Great! Adopting a thoughtful
view where you try to do the most good you can in everything (what job to have,
where to donate, how to use the limited resources you have, how to live your
life) is probably the most important step you can take. Since you’re visiting this
website, I imagine it’s a step you’ve already taken.

But what comes next? What career path offers the opportunity to do the most
good in the world? While I would definitely not claim to be an expert on the
subject, here are the best thoughts that I can share with you.

##The Issue
Naturally, one of the most important questions is what issue to focus on. Your
view on this may change in time; mine certainly did.

During most of college, the majority of my work was focused on social justice and
environmental activism. Eventually, however, I realized that it was in the area of
our planet’s use and abuse of animals that there was both the greatest amount
of physical and mental suffering, and the opportunity to reduce the greatest
amount of physical and mental suffering. (I do think that population control
efforts, particularly when focused on the industrialized world, may offer a similar
or possibly greater reduction in suffering for the same costs.) Certainly anti-
poverty efforts offer the potential to do enormous good as well, though as best I
can tell not to the same level as those other two issues. It’s certainly possible to
choose a career path prior to settling on the issue or issues you see as having
the highest impact, since most advocacy skills are translatable across fields. The
most important thing is continually honing the approach: how can I, and how can
this cause, accomplish more good?

2. College – I attended a mid-range (in terms of educational ranking) University
on the outskirts of New York City. When applying for colleges, I didn’t apply
to Ivy League universities because I wanted to go to a school that I thought
would have a more diverse student body, which it did. If I could go back in time
though, and were I ever to attend graduate school, I would absolutely choose as
prominent a school as possible – in the U.S., Yale or Harvard. Why? Because
of the connections. One of the most important things that you can take from
University, aside from the credentials that can allow you to make money to
donate, is connections. Given the number of future influencers, future wealthy
individuals, and future politicians and business leaders that occupy elite schools,
what better place to both make your mark in the short term (by constant on-
campus advocacy) and long term (through cultivating and maintaining friendships
with as broad a range of people as possible, and not just those who agree with
you on social or other issues).

3. Choice of Major – What major is most useful to having a high impact? One
way to approach things is to pursue the major that in the long term will allow
you to have the highest income, so that you can donate a maximum amount of
money to effective charities. Just imagine if, say, Warren Buffet, were a devoted
vegan or devoted supporter of efficient anti-poverty efforts. While few will ever
become billionaires, it’s certainly conceivable that entering certain business,
finance, medical or law fields can net you an income of hundreds of thousands to
a million dollars a year within a decade or so after college. The amount of good
you can do with an income like that is incredible. And, you’d likely be connected
with many other extremely wealthy and powerful individuals, which also has great
value. If this is your approach (and it is a very, very good approach), the best
thing to do would be to consider your skills and potential, examine the average
earnings of various fields, and pursue the career with the highest earning
potential (and a high likelihood of reaching that high earning potential).

On the other hand, if your goal is to work directly in the advocacy field, choice
of major is – in my opinion – generally irrelevant. My depth of experience is
generally confined to the field of animal advocacy, but in surveying that field as
a test case it’s clear to me that the most effective advocates do not have any
particular educational background. What makes them so effective is their hard
work ethic; their utilitarian approach; their great social skills; and their tactician’s
ability to get things done and move other entities in the right direction. None of
these things will be learned in the classroom, regardless of your major.

The skillset that will improve the total impact of any field of advocacy, whether
it is animal advocacy, anti-poverty efforts, or anything else, is not a particular
major. (Sorry lawyers, business students, and everyone else! Though from
the right school those can be helpful credentials for getting you into positions
of influence.) It’s those qualities I mention above. And it is building up your
intelligence of what works and what doesn’t in that field, so that after years of
experience you can help drive the field, or part of, in a smarter direction. Once
that is the case – once you are sure that you can do a better job than others in
position of influence – then you can do what is needed to insert yourself into as
powerful a position as possible, so that you can do the most good for the world.

But keep in mind this is not book or theoretical knowledge, it’s learned from
experience. Advocacy movements only respond to, people who carry out
a better approach, not describe one. Academics have virtually no impact
whatsoever, regardless of how great (or groundless) their theories and
suggested refinements are. Skills are learned through doing, succeeding, failing,
and – most importantly – always trying to emulate those who are doing things
best, and then improving upon them.

The one exception I’d point out in terms of career is pursuing a career where
you can bring about technological fixes to social problems. For example, if there
were even 5-10 smart young advocates who decided to pursue a career in food
science with the sole goal of hastening the production of commercially viable
in vitro meat, the results could be incredible. (Although, by the same token, if
you can take a very high paying job you can just hire others to do this work for
you. However there is something to be said for the passion that goes with doing
something yourself, so having animal advocates working on this issue would
likely yield much quicker results than hiring non-animal advocates who are only
doing the work for the paycheck and the scientific curiosity.)

Certainly similar technological breakthroughs may be able to help alleviate
other social and environmental issues. One other example of a technological
advancement that could eliminate a massive amount of suffering is the
development of simpler, cheaper sterilization procedures or contraceptive
drugs, such as this work currently being done in India. I do believe that the
most significant advances in bettering the world will come about in large part
through technological solutions (pushed into being sometimes by ethical motives,
sometimes by financial).

So there you have it! While I have no particular qualifications for providing career
advice for maximum social impact, I hope you’ll consider the above and I hope it
is of use to you! Feel free to email me at ncooney@farmsanctuary.org if I may be
of any assistance.

Yes, exactly. This is why I think outreach and spreading better values are usually more important than gaining more knowledge. Exceptions include (a) when you have to do some internal research just to know where to begin advocating and how best to do that, like with Effective Animal Activism and (b) cases like Robert Elwood’s research on crab sentience where the research itself can be one of the most compelling ways to make people care more about the topic and can serve as a way to channel and build concern for invertebrate suffering. In general, I think high-leverage research will usually look like activism (e.g., Peter Singer’s writings or the advice of 80,000 Hours).]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1039</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>jessa</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>j.ava@pdx.edu</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url></wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-05-04 18:34:57</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi!

I think there is a major opportunity for academics-namely when it comes to biological sciences.  Just as one brief example-in order to overcome animal testing models, animal advocates need to work from within the system to demonstrate more effective, non-animal models, which is far more effective than external activism.    Academics have a major influence on policy and life science academics could use skills for food policy, agriculture policy, scientific testing policy, etc.  Non-academic activists may be more effective at influencing the choices of individual consumers-but academics may be more effective at influencing the entire system.  Furthermore, academics become expert on a topic- and society at large is more inclined to listen to experts.

Also, I think there is an opportunity for a choice in undergraduate education to be extremely relevant & to make a major impact in one’s life and activism.  My undergraduate degree was in biology and the education completely shaped my entire view of the world.  When advocating I can make science-based arguments in anatomy, physiology, ethology, evolution, etc. and people I feel people tend to take my arguments to a higher consideration.  Also, I found I am much better able to understand the complex ecological impacts of animal agriculture.  And I can read, understand, and argue with scientific papers and research.   True, if I had chosen to major in medieval literature or business, it probably wouldn’t have made much of a difference to my advocacy skills-but a life science education gives one an advantage.

I would strongly recommend any one who is interested in animal advocacy, and also enjoys the process of gaining an education, to continue on in academia as far as they’d like.  If done strategically and if in the right subject, it has potential to make extreme impacts.

I often say that college is first about signalling your intelligence / work ethic, second about networking, and third about actually learning. It's not that you don't learn some insightful things in college, but you could learn those anywhere (reading textbooks, Wikipedia, etc.), and you don't need to pay big money to do that.

I agree with the comments about majors too. If you're entering a specialized field that requires a certain undergrad degree, it matters for that reason. If not, then major doesn't matter much, except again for signalling reasons. So it's generally good to choose a quantitative major for more effective signalling, although choosing something you enjoy and in which you'll get good grades is important too.

My experience is that for almost any job outside of academia, the actual content that you learn in college is mostly irrelevant. You learn what you need to know on the job itself. So college is basically an exercise gym and testing ground.

I'm not sure I agree that academics have almost no impact. It depends a lot on the field and the kind of work they do. It seems possible that Peter Singer has indirectly helped more animals than anyone else in world history, maybe several times more than the next person. Some fields of advocacy, like reducing wild-animal suffering or averting computational suffering in the far future, are heavily academic at this point because so little is known about the correct approach. Once a cause becomes more practical (like veg outreach is), at that point academic theories matter less. Still, they must be relevant, or else you wouldn't have relied on academic studies for "Change of Heart." :)

Brian - Touche, good points re academics :)  My only thoughts in response are: a) Singer had an impact because of his books, not teaching or research papers, though obviously those did rest on a bedrock of academia. not easy to follow in his footsteps though! b) def agree the work of academics can be very useful (good point there), i guess what i meant to say in the post is that for someone who wants to do the most good possible, that's not the place to do the most good. (Because other options can do more good, because the most useful research can be done or at least commissioned by non-academics who will know the most important things to research, and because a lot of the basic research already has been or will be done by people who would not otherwise spend their time doing great things for the world).

Two lines of thought are as follows (not refutations or criticisms -- just questions/observations/concerns/thoughts that have occurred to me as I've thought through these same issues):

1) You said you'd have chosen an Ivy League "given the number of future influencers, future wealthy individuals, and future politicians and business leaders that occupy elite schools."  My understanding, however, is that the elites at these schools tend to surround themselves with their peers (selective dining groups, sororities, etc. that recruit from their prep school networks) for a rather insular class experience.  I think one would have to be either lucky or a really charismatic extrovert to develop positive influence over these people.  And, finally, I wonder -- given that people who benefit from the status quo tend to believe in its worth more than others -- if those people would be less likely to listen to a more idealistic person.  The Tyson family's son went to Yale.  That's not proof, but it makes me wonder how many of these corporate families' kids would want to question the status quo thanks to a persuasive college friend or roommate?  These are empirical questions.  I just do not know the answers, but maybe you can find some folks who attended the Ivies as activists and idealists and can lend some insights?  It also strikes me that there might be a big trade-off between graduating with a bunch of student loan debt from a very expensive school versus a "free ride" at a "lesser" school?  Unless you're going to be a high earner, that debt might inhibit one's ability to choose a career as an activist or donate to charity.  Again, just some thoughts as you develop your own thoughts about this further.

2) There's a huge risk in assuming persons who become high earners with the idea of donating to charity will actually do so.  As you already know, what happens in our more and more stratefied society is that we only see and live near folks "like us."  First, this sets our idea of normal, so the richer you get, the more you still think of yourself as just middle class or not doing as well as so-and-so (e.g., the hedge fund managers who run to their therapists when their bonuses aren't as obscene as their colleagues').  In America, almost everyone thinks of themselves as middle class.  But, second, even if one could resist that temptation, there's a reason people try to live like others in their peer group.  If your home, car, etc. is not "up to par" to those you work with and who may be promoting you, this can really keep you from being advanced on the ladder because it signals your unworthiness ("He makes $65K and still drives that clunker to work -- can't see him as managing this department").  It's only after people know you're rich that you can step out of the need to impress.  It's very hard to get rich that way if you're depending on others to promote you or invest in you.  There's a reason the elites of society do -- and anthropologically almost always have -- devote large amounts of time and resources to signaling their wealth: It helps you get richer.  Remember all those psych studies where real experts are judged negatively in casual clothes while actors espousing b.s. -- but wearing clothes that fit the part -- were judged as competent.  The idealist who went into Wall Street or engineering, etc. to do well enough to give a lot to charity may well be held back if they give "too much."  And, even when they do "make it," when will they say enough is enough ... because (finally), since many people who were idealistic in youth will have children eventually and almost always transfer their altruistic energies to them first and foremost, being affluent just makes you more able to afford the better schools (either private or by buying homes in the expensive, affluent neighborhoods) and save for -- you guessed it -- expensive elite colleges!  And so the cycle continues.

Again, you have wonderful ideas and points.  This is "big thinking" that I would love to see more of.  Please continue to develop your ideas and gather information on this extremely important of questions!

Thanks for all you do!

I cannot tell you how cathartic it is to read that academics have virtually no impact. Now at the point of almost finishing my PhD, this has something that has troubled me for years and I CANNOT WAIT to be finished with academia and finally start achieving something good for the world.

From my time working in animal advocacy, I think technological skills that also cross into the creative realm are the best type to have. There is a huge need for activists with the ability to create good designs: print, online, merchandise, video, photography, etc. In addition, communication skills that are straightforward, creative, and usable in social media are highly sought after. I think this is one area where a particular major in comms or marketing is still useful. A lot of people think they have good communication skills - and perhaps they do have adequate skills, but not at the level high impact activists and activist groups require. This level can really only be achieved as a result of experiencing heavy editing by professors and student teachers who resent you and your brilliance ;-)

Kelly, thanks for your comments! RE: your point #1 I definitely agree that probably students at ivy league schools are going to be more insular and less likely than some other groups to be persuaded to be altruistic/vegetarian/devoted to making the world better/etc. But even if they were, say, 4 times harder to reach, I think they'd still be the ideal people to be networking with because of the influence those that you CAN reach will eventually have. RE: debt, that's a good point, though I'd guess that having a Yale/Harvard/etc diploma could help make up for that debt fairly quickly. 

I definitely agree with your second point as well - that a lot of people who say they will go into careers to make a lot of money to donate to charity will not really do it, for the same general reasons you outline above. However I think the value in connecting with such people still holds for two reasons. First, a lot of their value is not what they donate but the decisions they make from the positions of influence they may hold. IE if they are a politician, federal judge, business leader, etc., they don't have to donate a dime to help the world become better, if they are (as a result of your influence) more receptive to advocacy groups pushing for corporate or legislative change that can be a huge help. Second, it only takes one or two high earners who DO follow through to make an incredible impact. Look at the impact of Bill Gates on the world, for example. (not that everyone is going to be a billionaire :) ). But in the animal advocacy world i inhabit, for example, most farm animal protection groups have budgets under $2 million. Having just one or two millionaires who came to care about that issue (due to my influence if i went to school with them and befriended them) and donating heavily to it would make an insanely large difference in the lives of many animals.

I guess in a nutshell, i agree with both of your points but think that despite those limitations there still is a huge amount of potential value.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Making a difference through social entrepreneurship: an interview with Tom Rippin</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/253-making-a-difference-through-social-entrepreneurship-an-interview-with-tom-rippin</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[I spoke with [Tom Rippin](http://onpurpose.uk.com/portfolio-item/tom-rippin/), founder and CEO of [On Purpose](http://onpurpose.uk.com/on-purpose-explained/our-purpose-2/), a leadership programme aimed at *"attracting and developing talent to address the greatest issues faced by society and the environment."*

This supports the view we’ve expressed previously that working in the private sector early on in your career might be a great way to build career capital to have more impact later.

* **The social enterprise space might be less constrained by people who have ideas and want to start businesses, and more by people who actually have the skills to run and scale these businesses**. So developing these skills early on could be very valuable.

**Tell us a bit about your career background and the path that led you to set up On Purpose**

I started my career in academic research but soon discovered that wasn’t for me after all, and decided I wanted to get into international development. I spoke to various people who recommended I acquire some private sector skills first, so I joined management consultants McKinsey & Company.

It was here that I first came across social enterprise, in the form of bottom of the pyramid thinking in international development (which I was managing to do a bit of as a consultant) and I became really interested in applying this kind of thinking in the UK as well (which it turns out was already going on and had been for quite a while!).

After five years, I left McKinsey and worked first at Comic Relief and then at [RED] ([http://www.red.org](http://www.red.org/en/)) where I was able to undertake work that was combining commercial and social ways of working.

A little more than 2 years after leaving McKinsey, I started setting up On Purpose seriously. Part of what fueled this was lots of people coming and talking to me about how I had transitioned from consulting into social enterprise, and realising it could be very high value for me to help others undertake a similar transition. The other part was the realisation that if the fledgling social enterprise space is to be successful, it needs to be able to access, develop and retain the very best talent. On Purpose seemed like a great way to combine these two aims.

**Do you think starting at McKinsey was the right decision? What benefits did you get? What were the disadvantages?**

I went to McKinsey because I quite specifically wanted to acquire some private skills first. This idea stemmed from a conversation I had with someone who had done accountancy (which I would never had considered at the time) but then went on to do interesting work very quickly in international development. This switched on the light bulb that private sector skills can be very useful and accelerate a career in another sector, so that's what I went for.

I benefited hugely from getting a lot of training and development and getting an insight into a very diverse set of organisations. In addition I was working with senior management, which I would probably not have been exposed to in another job.

Whilst I was at McKinsey, my interests switched from international development to social enterprise; partly I realised I had never lived in a developing country but also, I realised that I found the concept of applying commercial dynamics to social and environmental issues really powerful. I also realised that this kind of work was also happening in the UK, right on my doorstep!

**What's the overall aim of On Purpose? What problem are you setting out to solve and how?**

We want to be part of developing a more sustainable way of organising our society and a more sustainable way of how we do business. Because we believe that no one quite knows what this new way is going to look like, we think that the smartest thing to do is to make sure some of the brightest and best people are working on figuring this out. So we find these people and equip them with the right skills, tools, experience and networks to set them up to contribute as much as possible over the rest of their career.

At a more tactical level, we are solving the problem that lots of talented professionals, especially ones who are still early on in their career, are really keen to work in social enterprise, but find it really difficult to get a full time, paid job. Historically, there has been quite a lot of support available for *entrepreneurs* who want to start up a social enterprise, but not for people changing careers and looking for *employment*.

**Why do you think getting more people into social enterprise will have a positive impact on wider society?**

Ultimately, the way society works at the moment is not sustainable - we can't afford the growth, the climate change or the inequality (to name but a few) that we are creating. The social enterprise movement (which I define quite broadly to include organisations that are innovating approaches that use commercial dynamics for social or environmental benefit) is, I think, an engine room for generating alternative approaches that will lead to a better way of running our society. Getting more people involved in this who are motivated, willing and able to contribute can only help!

**What do you think are the barriers to making a difference as a social entrepreneur at the moment? **

One of the topics that I find myself talking about quite a lot at the moment is that we don't actually need more social entrepreneurs (in the sense of people who start up organisations) but we rather need leaders who can build and run organisations. It's a big issue in the social enterprise space that very few organisations are growing to a national or international scale; how many national social enterprises can you name? One of the things that is lacking is the talent that can help run and scale an organisation, rather then start one up.

So in some ways, the big barrier that I see for social enterprise more generally, now that it has attracted a lot of social entrepreneurs, is: how does it attract the leaders that will make it successful beyond the start-up phase.

**Does this mean that you think there's less room to have an impact as an entrepreneur, and/or that there's less of a talent gap there? What are your main reasons for thinking this?**

There is of course a lot of room to have huge impact as an entrepreneur, but at the moment there is a relative lack of people who can build and run organisations - that is, to my mind, the bottleneck. So whilst entrepreneurs are very important there are quite a lot of them around and a high awareness of the need for them.  I think fewer people are aware for this need for builders and runners in social enterprise and hence finding and working with them is, we think, a very high-impact thing for us to do. 

**Why do you think getting involved in the social enterprise movement is one of the highest impact things to do? Why might this be wrong?**

I believe that because I believe in the power of social enterprise. I spent some time working with large charities and became very aware of how dependent and limited they can be because of the grants that they survive on. Social enterprise has the attraction that, if you can get it right, you can create and organisation that is not limited by the amount of grants or donations it can attract but is only limited by the size of the problem it is trying to solve.

Similarly, much of the private sector is subject to a bunch constraints and incentives that don't promote a very sustainable way of operating. Social enterprise, it's hoped can chart a course between the traditional charity and private sectors, combining the best of both worlds, whilst avoiding the pitfalls.

I also think that social enterprise can play and important catalytic role in getting conventional business and charities to change the way they currently work.

The reason this could be wrong is if social enterprise does not fulfil the promise it currently holds. Social enterprise is hugely exciting and inspiring at the moment, but in the grand scheme of things it is still very small. Unless it manages to grow significantly quite quickly, it's at the risk of being a quaint experiment that never quite fully took off.

**Tell us a bit more about how exactly the fellowship works. What kind of training and experiences do fellows get?**

To start off with, you go through a rigorous, but we hope also informative and fun, selection procedure. It's a competitive process that is comparable to some of the big city recruitment processes.

Once you are on the programme there are four main elements:

1. Two 6-month placements in organisations that are combining commercial and social ways of working. You get paid for this work and it's the best way to accumulate the all-so-important real-world experience

2. Half a day a week of training that covers a broad set of commercial, social and professional development topics. Most of these are delivered by senior people from the social enterprise and commercial networks that On Purpose has. It's also a great opportunity to meet regularly with your peers on the programme, compare notes and help each other with what you are doing

3. Fortnightly mentoring with seasoned professionals who are there to help you, in very hands-on ways, with the work you are delivering in your placements. Many of our mentors are current or ex strategy consultants and the opportunity to work closely with them is a huge opportunity

4. Quarterly coaching with qualified and experienced executive coaches. These sessions are there to help you make sure you make the most of the programme, take time to reflect, talk through any issues and make plans for the future. Again it's a fantastic experience that normally only more senior people get to access.

Beyond this though a lot of the value of the programme lies in the networks that you develop - with your peers, the alumni, placement organisations, trainers and many more. By the end of the programme our Associates (as we call the participants) highlight this as hugely valuable.

After the programme about half our Associates go on to work in one of their two placement organisations and the big majority of the rest of them find jobs elsewhere in the social enterprise space - most often through the networks created during the programme.

**Why do you think this training will help people to have more impact with their careers later?**

The overall programme helps you have more impact in your career because it not only gets you off to a great start in the social enterprise world, it also joins you to a community of like-minded individuals who will all be part of this same exciting movement and will help each other and others for years to come.

The half-day per week training specifically helps people acquire a high-level working knowledge of a wide range of topics that I believe you need to be successful in social enterprise. Because social enterprise works across the boundaries of so many sectors you need a much wider than usual set of skills and knowledge to be able to add value.

**How does On Purpose go about measuring its own impact?**

Ultimately, our impact is about the impact our Associates have on the organisations they work in, both during and beyond the programme. We currently measure this through a range of regular surveys of Associates, alumni and placement organisations. Interestingly though, this summer we have just been conducting a review of how we do this, so watch this space!

**What kinds of people are you looking for, and who is best suited to the fellowship?**

We are looking for motivated professionals with at least 2 years of experience (although on average our Associates have 5-7 years' experience). We don't mind what you've worked in before as long as you have a track record of achievement and can demonstrate a commitment to social issues. You can see a bit more about what we select people for here: [http://onpurpose.uk.com/become-an-on-purpose-associate/apply-today-2/what-we-look-for/](http://onpurpose.uk.com/become-an-on-purpose-associate/apply-today-2/what-we-look-for/)

</br>

The [best-selling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Ferriss) author, Tim Ferriss, promises to teach you how to cut your working week down to just [four hours](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/), using a careful combination of Indian virtual assistants, the 80/20 principle and automatic email responders.

But Ferriss has nothing on us. If your goal is to help others, then you can cut your *entire working year* down to just four hours.

Suppose your mission in life is to fight HIV/AIDS. Consider two charities.

</br>

1. The first prevents deaths due to AIDS by handing out antiretroviral therapy to people infected with the virus.

2. The second prevents deaths due to AIDS by educating people about the need for contraception through television shows.

</br>

**Which one should you work for?**

Both are producing massive benefits for others, but the second measure is cheap and preventative, so intuitively it looks like it might work better. To find out, let’s look at the latest cost-effectiveness research. 

According to the Disease Control Priorities Second Report, $500 used on antiretroviral therapy allows one person to live an extra year of healthy life. This is a great deal, working out at only 50c per hour. The same resources used on mass media education, however, allows about 500 people to live an extra year of healthy life[^1].

If both charities are roughly the same size, and you can make the same kind of contribution at each, then it seems like you can do about 500 times as much to fight AIDS at the mass media charity. For instance, suppose you make the charity more efficient, so that it has lower costs. Or you help them to fundraise more. Or you help them recruit another great employee who does either of these. In each case, the extra resources go 500 times as far at the second charity.

A year of work is about 2000 hours. So, an afternoon's work at the mass education charity does as much to fight HIV/AIDs as one long year of full-time work at the antiretrovial therapy charity.

It turns out that both of these charities exist. The [American Foundation for Children with AIDS](http://www.afcaids.org/programs/medicine) gives out antiretroviral therapy. [Development Media International](http://developmentmedia.net/) (which we’re proud to say includes a [member](http://80000hours.org/members/will-snell) of 80,000 Hours among its Directors) creates mass media campaigns in the developing world aimed at preventing sexually transmitted disases. We’re faced with choices like these all the time.

A four hour work week is 200 hours per year. So there you have it. Since we’re focused on helping others, we’ve managed to be 50 times better than Ferriss.

</br>

</br>

* * *

In fact, we can go even further. We’ve focused on a very narrow area: HIV/AIDS. The differences become even larger when we look at the entire range of ways to fight [global poverty](/global-poverty). Indeed, even in the areas we can’t as easily quantify, we should expect these huge differences will still exist. And finally, notice that although our estimate is very rough, the difference between the two options is so large that it’s good enough.

</br>

**What does this mean?** 

</br>

* You can have a huge impact. Raising $100,000 for the mass media charity (an easy amount for a charity fundraiser) could mean preventing an entire large village worth of people dying from AIDS.
* But you need to think about how best to go about it. Making some rough [estimates](http://80000hours.org/blog/79-quantification-part-2-the-dangers) could let you make hundreds of times more impact.

This report presents a summary report from each group, outlining their main concerns with comments on the overall progress of the organisation.* 

##Trustee Review

Our trustees are Toby Ord, Nick Beckstead and William MacAskill (who is also our President). 

Will issued the following statement:

* * *

>Overall, I think that 80,000 Hours has performed very well over the last 6 months. 

>*Some aspects that I found particularly impressive are:*

>**The leadership of the organisation.** There is a clear mission focus and unified culture within the organisation. This results in recruitment of staff and interns of exceptionally high quality.

>**The agility of the organisation.** I really get the sense that the 80,000 Hours team is focused on learning (a) what activities in general will have the biggest impact; and (b) what activities there is a particular niche for and that they can be particularly successful at. The team then modifies its plans, and even its nature as an organisation, on the basis of what they have learned. This focus on learning and improving bodes well for the future.

>**The development of the case-study model.** This model has the potential to answer my main concerns (below), and so I'm excited about finding out the effect it will have.

>**The substantial increase in members and web traffic**, which were considerably beyond expectations.

>*My principal concerns are as follows*:

>I would like to see some well-documented examples of significant career changes that are clearly attributable to 80,000 Hours in the past six months or year. Though there is good tracking of some important metrics (number of members, website traffic), I would like to see better tracking of this bottom-line metric. There are some clear examples of such changes from 80,000 Hours' early days. If this had continued (and grown) this would give me more confidence that the move from 80,000 Hours as primarily an advocacy organisation to primarily a service organisation was a good one.

>I would like to see more work on specific recommended career paths other than earning to give. At the moment, if one looks through the 80,000 Hours website, there is still little in the way of concrete advice other the recommendation of earning to give, with most content being at a more general or abstract level (e.g. the relevance of personality to one's career choice, or work on the conceptual framing of career decisions).  I'm hoping that the write-ups of the case studies will provide this information.

* * *

##Advisory Board Review

Our advisory board consists of: James Norris, Alex Flint and Jeff Kaufman. The members are chosen as supporters of our mission and effective altruism, who are not otherwise involved in running the organisation. We encourage them to act as impartial critics of our approach. One is a major donor to 80,000 Hours, two are highly active in building the effective altruism community and two have entrepreneurial experience.


Alex issued the following statement on behalf of the advisory board:



>The 80,000 Hours advisory board met on August 27th. Present were Jeff Kaufman, James Norris, Alex Flint, and Ben Todd. The advisory board found the overall progress made by 80,000 Hours during the past 6 months highly encouraging and were positive about its plans for the future. The following are some takeaways from the meeting.

>One concern raised by the board was the uncertainty around whether clients of 80,000 Hours really make major career changes as a result of 80,000 Hours' coaching. Sub-questions include whether clients make plans to change their career, whether they follow through on those plans, how long that change persists for, and whether the ultimate beneficiary causes are effective. Neither the board nor 80,000 Hours has definitive answers to these questions but the current evidence available to 80,000 Hours (including surveys, self-reports, and anecdotes) indicates that 80,000 Hours’ effectiveness is competitive with GiveWell’s top-rated charities.

>The board was was impressed by the performance of the 80,000 Hours leadership over the past 6 months in dealing with issues ranging over management, marketing, credibility, and developing the new business model. In particular, the willingness of the leadership to reflect critically on mistakes and make efforts towards transparency were highly encouraging.

>Some discussion was given to whether 80,000 Hours should target a very wide “mass-market” audience, or instead focus energy on high-impact individuals. Some members of the board felt that the potential payoff from a mass-market success made this avenue attractive, even given the high risk. Others argued that the value of career advice is concentrated in top-performing individuals and that 80,000 Hours’ efforts should be similarly concentrated.

>Key issues facing 80,000 Hours over the next six months include fundraising and recruitment. 80,000 Hours’ internship programme gives it access to a large talent pool, although the salaries it pays to full-time personnel are low even compared to other non-profits. Constant fundraising could distract 80,000 Hours from execution on long-term goals and care should be taken to avoid having it consume too much of the leadership’s time.

>Overall, the board was encouraged by the results from the past six months and felt that 80,000 Hours is well poised to execute on its mission over the coming years.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>ü</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2013-09-03 23:00:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status></item><item><title>How to choose a degree - what do employers want?</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/143-how-to-choose-a-degree-what-do-employers-want</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[In my [last post](http://80000hours.org/blog/142-how-to-choose-a-degree-for-earning-to-give-and-research) I looked at the role of degree choice for professional and academic careers. Now let’s branch out and look at the more general role of degree choice. This matters for people interested in [Advocacy](/advocacy), [Innovation](/innovation), [Improving](/improving) as well as [Earning to Give](/earning-to-give) in non-professional careers. At this stage in our research, it seems that degrees in more quantitative subjects improve your employment prospects and your flexibility, which is important for making a difference. The next most important thing is to pick a degree you expect to do well in. But, again, we’ll be refining that view as we explore more of the evidence.

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/72/original/Students.jpg?1357601554'><img alt="Students" align="center" class="image large" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/72/large/Students.jpg?1357601554" /></a> 

###Employers like Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths

Once again, degree choice is not going to close off most of your options. In the UK, 80% of employers don’t have specific subject requirements for their graduate roles, according to [CBI/Pearson Education and Skills Survey 2012]( http://www.cbi.org.uk/media/1514978/cbi_education_and_skills_survey_2012.pdf). But the subject you choose does make a difference to them. 72% say that they are on the lookout for graduates from certain subjects (compared with 46% who say degree class is one of the most important criteria). Fully 50% of employers say that they are looking for graduates from Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) degrees. 17% want students with Business degrees. Only 2% want linguists, 2% social scientists, and 1% arts students.

That suggests that quantitative STEM subjects give you far more career flexibility and hiring prospects than other courses. But it is worth remembering that this is only a report of employers’ stated preferences, not a report of their actual behaviour.

###Doing more quantitative subjects signals intelligence

There’s also an interesting signalling effect. Many employers want to have intelligent employees. And it turns out that your degree choice does, to an extent, signal the level of intelligence you have. Many of the stereotypes we have here are fairly accurate. This table ([part 1](http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/73/original/IQbymajor-1.jpg?1357601555) and [part 2](http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/74/original/IQbymajor-2.jpg?1357601556)) shows the average SAT scores of US students by major choice using data from ETS, and maps the SAT scores onto an IQ score. (SAT scores are pretty good proxies for IQ scores.) Subjects like Physics, Math, Engineering and Philosophy lead the pack, with subjects getting less and less quantitative lower down with Social Work at the bottom.

Now this isn’t to say that all people who study Physics are smarter than people who study Social Work. It isn’t actually even saying that you have to be smarter to understand Physics than Social Work. It might just be that smart people tend to go into Physics because they feel like that’s what smart people ought to do. That is, the stereotypes might be self-reinforcing.

But it does suggest that if you know nothing about someone except what their major was, and you then have to guess how bright they are, you can expect that a Physics student is smart. In the case of many potential employers, that’s a relevant consideration. It also means that if you know someone studied, e.g., Physics and they did very well then they are probably very smart. But if you know someone did very well studying Social Work then you still don’t have good evidence that they are very smart (although they might be).

###Quantitative subjects lead to more graduate jobs

We also want to look at the employment rates of people who finish various courses. The data table [here]( http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/careers/what-do-graduates-do/) reformatted from the survey by the Higher Education Career Services Unit [here]( http://www.hecsu.ac.uk/assets/assets/documents/WDGD_Oct_2012.pdf) shows the employment profiles of graduates from a range of subjects 6 months after graduation. It assumes that the outcome you want after your degree is to either be doing further study, be employed in a graduate job, or to be doing a combination of study and work. If that is what you want, then a familiar pattern emerges with Medicine- and Engineering-related subjects doing the best, followed by sciences and the harder social sciences like Economics, with Education thrown in there.

That is a little misleading, because not all of the further study is eventually going to lead to a graduate career, and is often not worth it for its own sake. People who study science are more likely to go into graduate degrees than other subjects, and some of those won’t actually end up with graduate jobs. 

Looking into the subject-by-subject breakdown, though, you learn that in most artsy degrees about 20-25% of employed graduates are working in Retail, Catering, Waiting and Bar Staff. While that isn’t necessarily a problem, it’s also probably not what you went into the degree to do. 

But we have evidence that the average science student is smarter than the average student in other disciplines. That’s a huge confounding factor, since we would expect smarter people to be better at finding jobs (general mental ability is strongly correlated with job performance – for an overview of the evidence see [here](http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Principles-Organizational-Behavior-Evidence-Based/dp/0470740949)). That should make us very suspicious about how much of the improved outcome is down to the scientific degree relative to the ability of the student.

All of this is based on data about all people who go to university in the UK. If you are towards the top of the skill distribution, you might have a very different set of outcomes. In the future we’ll look at how this is different for top students.

So although there are some questions about which factors are playing a causal role, it seems that STEM courses and medical courses will help you make a difference more than humanities or arts courses.

There are some important questions that I haven’t addressed yet, but might in the future if readers think it would be useful. For example,
- How exactly do employers use degrees when making decisions? In particular, how differently do they treat degrees from elite universities? (Self-reported surveys say they don’t pay attention, but anecdotal evidence suggests they do.) Is it worth taking a gap year to reapply if you don’t get into a top university?
- Which degrees increase your earning potential the most? (This is not the same as asking which graduates have the highest earnings.)
- Which degrees give you the best general transferrable skills?
- What are the major predictors of success at university and how can you use these to decide what to study?
- How can you work out if going to university is worth the investment of time and money?

In my [next post](http://80000hours.org/blog/144-10-steps-to-choosing-your-degree) I’ll start outlining a way to structure your subject decision-making.

*This is the fourth post (of a series of six) on our six month evaluation*

This report outlines our key financial metrics.

## Summary
</br>
**80,000 Hours is seeking to raise £360,000 over the next year to cover operating expenses for July 2013 – June 2015.** This would cover all of 80,000 Hours’ expenses for this year and give 80,000 Hours 12 months of cash reserves, which would be very valuable for improved organizational planning and stability. Raising £245,000 by June 2014 would give us 6 months of cash reserves.

This will enable us to carry out our plans to develop and promote our content about which careers make the most difference, as outlined in  [our team plan](http://80000hours.org/blog/250-team-plan).

**80,000 Hours’ current financial situation**: As of 20 August 2013, 80,000 Hours has about £30,000 of cash on hand, which is about 2 months of reserves. 80,000 Hours’ estimated budget for July 2013 – June 2014 is £160,000. 80,000 Hours’ estimated budget for July 2014 - June 2015 is £230,000. In the last year, 80,000 Hours raised £100,000, so we would like funds raised this year to increase by £260,000.

## Historical spending
</br>
Over our previous budgeting period (July 2012 - June 2013) we spent £79,000.  Overall, we spent slightly more than the £73,000 originally budgeted for. We went under budget in most areas, but spent significantly more on intern expenses than projected because we identified several very high quality interns.

Spending was dominated by employees and intern expenses: 

* Of our total budget, about 45% was spent on employee pay

* 40% was spent on intern living and housing expenses

* Of the remainder, the largest expense was the office at 8% of the total.

Over the six month review period [we spent £46,000](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsOdBVMpAjJHdE5qZTlMNnhkMTh1S0dENURjM2NUdWc#gid=1). This was 2.6 times the previous six month period. The increase was due to:

* hiring a second staff member

* hiring two extra interns

* making upfront payments and paying deposits for housing

In total, we averaged 2.7 full-time staff and 4.7 full-time interns over the period. We believe this represents exceptional value given the quality of our staff. The total cost per full-time team member has been less than £11,000 per year including the office and all expenses.

## Historical Fundraising
</br>
* In the last year, 80,000 Hours has raised £100,000 in funds.

* Since founding, 80,000 Hours has raised £110,000 in funds.

* About 60% of funds were restricted to 80,000 Hours. The other 40% were donated to CEA as unrestricted funds, and 80,000 Hours has received just over 50% of CEA’s unrestricted funds to date.

## Projected spending
</br>
### During the next budgeting period (July 2013 - June 2014)
</br>
Our central case budget involves spending about £160,000.

Note that we plan to review this budget (i) in one month when we see the results of our recent hiring round (ii) at our next six month review.

This represents roughly a doubling of the budget compared to the previous period. The main changes are to:

* Bring the average number of full-time staff up from 2.7 to 6.6. The increase comes from (i) hiring 50% of an ED of CEA (ii) hiring 50% of an additional full-time finance officer and director of fundraising to central CEA (iii) hiring an additional full-time member of the 80,000 Hours careers team

* Increase the average number of interns from 4.7 to 6.7. This is from hiring an extra two interns to central CEA and an extra intern to work on communications at 80,000 Hours.

* Increase office expenses by about £8,000 per year to cover our new Oxford university office space.

If we covered this budget, we don’t think it would exhaust our room for funding. If given more funding, it is likely we could hire staff earlier and usefully increase the number of interns by 1.5, to reach a total budget of around £185,000.

The minimum we could comfortably spend is around £120,000. This would involve not hiring additional staff and letting the number of interns reduce to about 5 (from 6.5 currently). 

### During the following budgeting period (July 2014 - June 2015)
</br>
Our central case budget involves spending £230,000, although note this is highly likely to be reviewed.

If we didn’t take on further staff after June 2014, we would spend about £210,000. It is also likely we could spend significantly more than the central case.

### Beyond July 2015
</br>
We’re highly uncertain about what level of budget will be effective, but we certainly have the potential to massively scale up our model.

## Reserves policy
</br>
We strongly prioritise having at least 6 months of cash reserves, and aim to have at least 12 months. We regard 3 months as probably not providing enough margin for error, and will curtail expansion while reserves are below 3 months.

We chose this level because:

* It takes us between 3-12 months to fundraise, and it is difficult to reduce expenses significantly within a year. Historically, we’ve found that fundraising from individuals takes around 3 months from when we contact them to when we receive the income. At the margin, many of our fundraising opportunities involve grants, which take 6-12 months to receive. On the expenses side, it is difficult to reduce our number of staff in less than 6 months. Overall, 6 months of reserves gives us a reasonable margin for error if a round of fundraising goes worse than expected.

* 6 months of reserves (or ideally higher) makes it easier to plan the next financial year. In practice, we need to commit to hiring people for at least a year, as well as make long-term commitments to other expenses like our office. A year of reserves would make us better able to confidently accept these future expenses.

* It is conventional in the charity sector to have 3-12 months of cash reserves, and seems to be regarded as good practice to have 6-18. For instance, GiveWell prefers charities to have [at least 6 months of reserves](http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/financial-metrics) (though regards more than 24 months as worrying or unnecessary). Charity Navigator [gives higher scores](http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=48#.Ug4Qg5KXR8E) to charities who have at least 6 months of reserves, with the highest scores going to charities that have at least 12 months of reserves.

## Room for more funding July 2013 - June 2014
</br>
We currently have about £30,000 of cash on hand, which is about 2 months reserves.

Our central case budget for July 2013 - June 2014 is £160,000. 

Our central case budget for July 2014 - June 2015 is £230,000.

Thus, to reach 6 months of reserves by the end of June 2014, we need revenue of £245,000 this year.

To reach 12 months of reserves, we need additional revenue of £360,000.

We believe we have capacity to spend up to £180,000 from July 2013 to June 2014, so to reach our maximum rate of expansion and raise 12 months of reserves, our room for more funding before June 2014 is £380,000.

The purpose of the evaluation is to explain to key stakeholders our progress, plans for the future and how we think we're performing as an organisation. The main model for our evaluation process is [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org/about/self-evaluation).

In this report, we outline how we see our main achievements and mistakes over the last six months.

## Summary
</br>
* Our key priority was further developing our business model and content strategy, and we’re pleased with our success in this area. We made two rounds of improvements, culminating with adopting the [case study model](http://80000hours.org/blog/232-we-re-changing-our-career-coaching).

* Our next major priority was further building 80,000 Hours and the Centre for Effective Altruism as robust, effective organisations. We made mistakes in this area, but overall I think we made strong progress. We successfully coped with a doubling of the number of people working at the Centre for Effective Altruism.

* While prioritising developing our business model and organisation building, we’ve also performed strongly in outreach. Our web traffic increased by 47% and we recruited about 400 new members, which was well ahead of expectations.

* We made many mistakes this period, but I'd classify most as minor mistakes. The worst mistake was that the operations team ran out of capacity in March, slowing down our overall progress.

* Overall, I think we’re in a strong position to carry out our plans over the next six months.

 

## Our Achievements

### Learning about and improving our business model

I continue to see our main priority as developing a proven, scalable business model that cost-effectively creates impact through improving careers. **This period was a success for this aim, and resulted in two significant improvements to our content strategy, **with the result that we will take research forward with the [case study model](http://80000hours.org/blog/232-we-re-changing-our-career-coaching).

** **

*In November 2012*



We had a long list of content ideas (career profiles, cause reviews, reviews of high impact 'activities' like Earning to Give, comparisons of activities, decision processes, material on job satisfaction, etc.). We didn't have a systematic advising process. Our plan was to (i) work on clarifying which career problems we should focus on (ii) develop demo versions for each of the content types (iii) test out these demos in one-on-ones and on the blog.

 

*In March 2013*

 

**The new plan:** After preparing demo content for each type, further thinking about how to organise our content, further thinking about how to measure our impact, interviewing about 40 people about their career problems, and carrying out more surveying of other providers of career advice, we decided to create the following content: (i) rankings of 10 careers in terms of impact, based on a framework (ii) a similar ranking of causes (iii) a step-by-step career planning process based on a standardised form of career plan.

 

We decided to deliver this content through (1) a series of three intro lectures to introduce the rankings and planning processes (2) blog sequences (3) a one-on-one coaching process.

 

**Why?:** We think this plan was an improvement, since (a) it was much more focused on answering 'in which career can you have most impact?' which seems to be the issue we should focus on in order to have the most impact (b) it provided a list of concrete jobs to take, which was one of the most widely desired content types we uncovered (c) it provided an individualised process for narrowing down these jobs, which was also widely desired (d) it has a strong structure that people could follow on the blog (e) we suspect the idea of 'career rankings' could become widely shared.

 

We chose these delivery methods because (a) the videos and blog sequences are highly scalable, and the one-on-one coaching is somewhat scalable because we could make it more and more systematic over time (b) after testing out the coaching, we realised some standard intro content would be useful, and we suspected videos would be particularly popular (c) we also needed a general intro video to explain 80,000 Hours (d) blog sequences are a relatively quick way to communicate research and can build up a following over time (e) we included the coaching because there is strong demand for one-on-one help and it allows us to connect with very high impact people.

 

*In late May 2013 *

 

**What we learned:** We decided to discontinue the rankings, because after doing more coaching and attempting to work on the rankings (i) we realised the research might not be decision relevant (ii) the research would likely be too superficial to appear credible. Similarly, we decided to deprioritise developing the planning process since it seemed we didn't know enough about successfully choosing careers for further work to be justified. We also decided that we need to spend more time understanding precisely what career problems are the most pressing for people who care about making a difference in an effective way. Although we had identified some broad areas, we were still highly uncertain about what research would have the most leverage.

 

**The new plan:** Instead, we decided to: (i) write up our existing thoughts on frameworks for comparing careers and career planning for our findings page (ii) carry out further research using the case study model. In the case study model, we speak to 1-2 coachees each week, spend ~4 days working on their career decision, write the study up on the blog, and over time spot general patterns that we write up for the findings page.

 

**Why?:** We're pursuing the write up because we're fairly confident the frameworks we developed are useful for comparing and planning careers, having tested them with lots of people one-on-one, and they'll form a good starting position for our research that we can develop through case studies. The case study model addresses the problems above because the extra time spent on each person means we can do our best to ensure our research is relevant to their decision and carry out the research in enough depth to be credible. Over time we end up with a sampling of the career problems of our target audience, so our research time is spent in proportion to how widely held each problem is.

 

The model offers some additional advantages: (i) it will be easier to track our impact (ii) we suspect the case studies will be perceived as highly valuable, increasing our reach with the most able people (iii) we will be more helpful to the most high potential people who care about making a difference in an effective way (iv) having lots of stories of high impact people could be inspiring and engaging. Another reason we adopted this model is that we realised we didn't need to do as much work to gain broad appeal. Publicity by Peter Singer, the media and the general growth of effective altruism is bringing in a significant number of people who already want to engage deeply with our ideas.

 

The main disadvantage is that we will initially speak to fewer people one-on-one and produce less widely applicable written content. **This could decrease our short-term impact and web traffic**, in return for better content in the long-term. We can slightly offset this disadvantage by preferring to work on questions that are more generalizable.

 

 

*What else did we learn?*

1. **We gained further evidence that there is enough demand for our programs**. Despite minimal outreach effort, we were able to increase web traffic 40%, gain major press coverage and gain 400 members.

2. **Nick Beckstead performed a** [ trustee evaluation of our impact to date](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8OdBVMpAjJHQWJEZC1QeFhIYnc/edit). Our key conclusions were (a) our best guess is that our current programs already justify our costs on the margin solely due to the additional individual future *donations* they raise for effective charities (though with large uncertainty) (b) we are part of the way towards having a model that creates impact by changing careers, but we need more evidence concerning how we change careers. This suggests we should focus future evaluation efforts on working out whether we have programs that actually improve careers.

### Further organisation building of 80,000 Hours and the Centre for Effective Altruism
</br>
1. **We strengthened the team** since (i) Jess and Roman took on management roles, freeing up my time (ii) we attracted a very strong pool of interns in our recruitment process, often very dedicated top students (iii) we improved our staff training (iv) Niel successfully ran 80,000 Hours while I took time off, increasing the robustness of the organisation (v) we continued to learn about management and leadership.

2. **Made progress on improving central CEA and freeing up my time from operations** by making plans for Niel to become the ED of CEA in September, improving planning in operations and improving reporting in operations.

3. **Coped well with growth.** Despite problems applying for visas for American volunteers, operations successfully dealt with CEA having twice as many staff.

4. **Increased transparency** by (i) starting weekly strategy lunches (ii) creating the 80k_updates mail list to expand the weekly impact report beyond the team (email ben@80000hours.org if you would like to be added) (iii) making more effort to explain strategy to the team (iv) starting more explanation of our plans on the blog. More efforts will be implemented after the review.

### Invested in content
</br>
1. **Created the three intro videos** filling a need for engaging, summarised intro content.

2. **Developed and tested some key frameworks:** how to compare careers and causes, and how to structure a career plan. We think these are immediately useful and will provide a structure for future content.

3. **Wrote over 60 blog posts** and did research on the causes of job satisfaction, how biases effect career decisions, intelligence/personality/experience as predictors of success, models for expected earnings, a process for picking a thesis, how to estimate, a process for picking a major, the potential to improve research careers, GiveWell as a career option and the best productivity boosting techniques.

4. **Made significant improvements to the online profiles** which significantly increased completion rates

### Outreach Impact
</br>
As with the last period, we're more focused on developing our business model than impact; nevertheless, **it was a very successful period, which exceeded our expectations.**

1. **Unique visits to the site increased 47%** on the last 6 months, despite low Christmas traffic. Around half of this was due to three rounds of [press coverage](http://80000hours.org/blog/227-80-000-hours-in-the-washington-post-our-responses-to-the-coverage), including TED, The Washington Post, Quartz, The Daily Mail and NPR. I don't expect to continue growing at this rate unless we attract further coverage or ramp up our investment in outreach.

2. This led to **400 new members**. That's over twice as many as the previous period, and beat our expectations. **We're on course to reach 1000 members by the end of August, a stretch goal we only gave 10% odds last summer.** The increase was faster than the increase in web traffic, because we improved conversion in November. *In the future, I expect member growth to be in line with traffic growth.*

3. **We gave over 40 people one-on-one coaching**, out of about 150 requests.

4. **Of new members, 53 reported anticipating a "significant" or 'complete' career change.** It seems that we are causing some significant career changes, particularly among one-on-one coachees, but we do not yet have good enough evidence the typical scale and type of changes.

5. We expect this to result in future, time-discounted, counterfactually adjusted donations to top charities on the order of a million dollars. For more on this estimate and our cost-effective, please see our [Evaluation of 80,000 Hours as a Project](http://80000hours.org/blog/248-evaluation-of-80-000-hours-as-project). 

6. **We continue to have success in assisting with starting new projects.** Our first spin-off, Effective Animal Activism, hired a full-time Executive Director, and has now attracted funding pledges of $60,000. **We're advising Alex Hoye** about assisting in setting up an incubator for effective altruist for-profit start-ups.

7. Our community is also starting to help people to find jobs and we now have engaged members in Google, McKinsey, Jane St, Rothschild and other high profile firms.

8. **We're starting to have success as a headhunter.** Our [blog posts about GiveWell](http://80000hours.org/blog/173-looking-for-a-seriously-high-impact-job-using-your-analytical-skills) resulted in a new trial hire and a temporary hire at Giving What We Can discovered the job through our mailing list.

 

 

### Mistakes and ways things could have gone better

 

1. **We think largest mistake was that we ran out of capacity in the operations team around March.** This resulted in delays of over a month to the arrival of two interns, since we were unable to complete their visa applications in time, and a meant the 80,000 Hours ED had to spend a significant amount of time on operations (around 50% at peak). This happened because (i) we didn't make a sufficiently detailed plan for operations at the beginning of the period, so we didn't recruit enough interns to meet demand (ii) we were overoptimistic about how much time operations required (iii) Tom wasn't given enough authority to make the decisions himself. We think we've fixed this by: (a) Making Niel the ED of CEA from September.  In this role, he will spend about 50% of his time running central CEA. This should increase the decision making capacity covering difficult central issues, like the office, legal risks, the relationship with other organisations and recruitment. The role will also create a single point of contact for these issues, and the other one-off issues that arise for CEA. (b) Asking Tom to draw up more detailed plans (c) Hiring more interns for operations. In addition, we may need to hire a second full-time staff member for operations, but that decision is still under review.

 

The following are ways we could have been slightly more effective over the period. They are not in order.

1. **We invested too much time in the intro videos.** This was partly due to under-estimating how long they would take (particularly recording and editing the audio), and we've updated our estimates. It was also due to not having a clear enough brief of the purpose of the videos. We should have started the process by ensuring that everyone involved really clearly understood their purpose. Finally, we think we made the videos too long. Although a 3 minute intro video is very useful, it's not clear that the second and third videos were worth the additional time compared to putting the same ideas in a blog post. Although video content may be more popular, for this type of content it doesn't seem to justify spending more than 10x as much time to create.

2. **Over-frugality.** We think we could have been in a better position if we had been prepared to invest more in website design and office space. In the past, we have done website design in house for very little money. This cost significant time that could have been used on research and resulted in lower standards. We think it would have been worth spending several thousand pounds to receive professional web design. We partly avoided this because we were unsure of how much money we could fundraise, but it seems like we were slow to update on new data. I think a similar thing is true for office space.

3. **At the start of the period, I think I was spending too much of my time on management, and not enough on taking the lead with our content.** We've made progress on fixing this by training Jess and Roman as managers, and slightly reducing how many interns and volunteers we have. I still have more to learn about how to manage managers.

4. **Not being focused enough with content.** Although we've been becoming more focused over time, I have sometimes approved content that seemed valuable, despite not being core to our plans. Although the decisions in isolation seemed good, in aggregate, they contribute to a lack of structure on the blog and delayed our core mission. In addition, it's easy to make the planning fallacy and underestimate how much time they take from the mission. In the future, additional research will all be tied to case studies, which will force it to be relevant to choosing between careers.

5. **Didn't have enough narrative and structure on the blog.** This was because I wasn't sure how to structure our content or what was best to work on, and also because I wanted to be flexible with what content the interns worked on in order to attract talent. The case study model will allow us to have a much clearer narrative in the future, and we've improved our ability to attract interns.

6. **Spent slightly too much time on outreach rather than accelerating the development of our content and model.** In particular, I think we spoke to slightly too many people one-on-one rather than focusing on provably changing the careers of the most promising people, and Niel spent too much of his energy on events in Oxford. We're addressing this by adopting the case study model and making the university chapters more autonomous.

7. **Not enough transparency about strategy.** Several team members and outside supporters felt they didn't understand our plans during the period. We worked on this by taking the steps listed in 'organisation building' above.

8. **Not offering longer internships.** We have in the past avoided offering internships longer than 3-4 months out of caution. In practice, we have almost always been happy for interns to stay longer than 3-4 months, which we knew by autumn 2012. By not promoting long stays and recruiting for them, I think we've had higher intern turn-over than necessary, which is a significant cost. We're addressing this by advertising 8-10 month internships in the next recruitment process.

9. **Not fundraising more from outside the effective giving community**. It would have significantly reduced the opportunity cost of our funds and increased our financial robustness. We think it would have taken somewhat more time, but not as much as our original estimates.

10. **Significantly underestimated how long it would take to get clearance to move into the FHI from the university.** This cost us in having a significantly worse office for seven months. We will be more conservative about estimates involving university bureaucracy in the future.

11. **Financial reporting not clear enough.** Will wasn't clear what his fundraising goals should be far enough in advance. Our reports were difficult to understand. We're working on this by making Tom the finance officer and giving more feedback on the reports.

 

 

### Was it a mistake not to start the case study model earlier?
</br>
Nick suggested an approach similar to the case study model in summer 2012. Now, almost a year later, we've adopted it. Was it a mistake not to adopt it sooner?

 

I don't think it was a mistake not to immediately start the case study model once we started to prioritise content and strategy development in November 2012. At that point, we thought it was likely to be more effective to create less in-depth content that was more widely applicable, so it was worth experimenting further with this approach. Moreover, there were other strategic issues that I wanted to work on at the time, like understanding conventional careers advising. And finally, we didn't seem to have anyone on the team with the time and inclination to do case studies.

 

The mistakes I think we did make were (i) spending too much time on outreach rather than content and strategy development and (ii) not always being focused enough with content. These slowed down our arrival at the case study model.

 

## How did we Perform Relative to our Stated Goals?
</br>
**Overall, I think we performed well relative to our stated goals in the last review and to our updated goals set in March. Our main failures were modest delays due to the planning fallacy. The additional differences are due to the mistakes listed above.**

** **

*In November 2012*

** **

Initially our main priorities were carrying out (i) further research into which customer problems we should address (ii) the plans to develop a package of demo content based on our best guess content (iii) the annual impact survey (iv) the recruitment process.

 

*Progress up to March 2013*

 

We were largely successful in these aims in the short term. The recruitment process was finished late by about a month, which was due to (a) waiting two weeks on a third party (b) underestimating the time required. (i)-(iii) precipitated a shift in strategy in early March, which meant that we didn't continue with the rest of the goals in the plan.

The strategic shift led to a new set of goals for the end of May, which most importantly included (i) creating new impact tracking plans (ii) developing a series of three intro lectures as our main intro content on the site and (iii) creating a first version of a systematic one-on-one advising process. In operations, the key goals switched to finding housing and doing visa applications for the influx of staff starting in June.

 

*Progress up to June 2013*

 

We were successful in (i) and (ii), except the site was only fully updated in early June. (iii) was about 60% completed. We also fell behind on several more minor goals. This was because creating the intro videos took more than 4 person-weeks longer than planned. In particular, we underestimated how long the audio and editing would take. In addition, Niel had to spend much longer on operations than planned, due to the capacity crunch noted in 'Mistakes’.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>ö</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2013-08-27 15:05:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status></item><item><title>Should more altruists consider entrepreneurship?</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/256-should-more-altruists-consider-entrepreneurship</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href='http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eightythousand/posts/images/226/original/800px-Berlin_Hackathon_2012-46.jpg?1380562828'><img alt="800px-berlin_hackathon_2012-46" class="image large" src="http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eightythousand/posts/images/226/large/800px-Berlin_Hackathon_2012-46.jpg?1380562828" /></a>

*Many thanks to [Spencer Greenberg](http://www.spencergreenberg.com/), whose talk “When Startups Help the World” given at the recent Effective Altruism Summit inspired many of the ideas in this post, and motivated much of the upcoming research on entrepreneurship.*

***

One thing you might consider, if you’re aiming to do the most good with your career, is going into entrepreneurship. In this post I’ll summarise our reasons for thinking for-profit entrepreneurship[^1] is a promising career path for altruists, and outline our plans for research which will form the later parts of this blog series.

In summary:

* For-profit entrepreneurship is potentially one of the highest earning careers, making it an attractive option for earning to give
* It seems more promising than other high-earning careers for doing good directly, because you have the option to sell products that help the world, and contribute to innovation in the economy 
* Furthermore, we think that startups may be one of the best ways to build career capital early on in your career

I’ll now talk about each of these points in a little more detail.


**High expected earnings**

We’ve [made the point previously on the 80k blog](http://80000hours.org/blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers) that, if your aim is to maximise your earnings to maximise your charitable donations, you might want to consider entrepreneurship. A 2007 study by Hall and Woodward [^2] of thousands of American startups finds the average founding team’s earnings by time of exit are a massive $9 million. This gives us further reason to think entrepreneurship is promising as a high earning career, but how it compares in expectation to salaried careers like finance is still highly uncertain (especially once you take personal factors into account). In particular, this study only looked at teams who had already received VC funding, and we have little idea what an individual’s chances of getting VC funding are. So we’re currently looking into these elements in more detail in order to refine these estimates, and we’ll report our findings in a later post.

Another consideration when comparing entrepreneurship to salaried careers is that it’s a comparatively high-risk strategy. Although expected earnings might be high, the distribution is highly skewed, meaning chances of failure are also high. There are reasons to think [this should matter less if your aims are altruistic](http://80000hours.org/blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers), but the personal risk may still be off-putting. We’re investigating how best to deal with this problem, and hope to talk more about mitigating the personal risk involved in entrepreneurship in future.

**Selling products that help the world**

Unlike many typical high-earning careers where your main focus is making as much money as possible, entrepreneurship is also potentially a great way to do good directly. If you can sell a product that improves the life of each person who buys it, and you manage to sell your product to a million people, you’ve done a huge amount of good. Products that make people [happier](http://happyrambles.com/), [healthier](http://www.glassfitgames.com/), [better at making decisions](http://www.clearerthinking.org/) or [achieving their goals](https://www.beeminder.com/) are likely to have a big positive impact on peoples’ lives and the world.

Of course, in practice there are a lot more complicated considerations when thinking about your direct impact. As always when we talk about “making a difference”, it’s important to ask what would have happened otherwise. What would the customer have done with their money if they hadn’t bought your product? Where would the funder’s money have gone? Your impact is only net positive if the product benefits the customer *more* than what they would have bought instead, and your funding wouldn’t have gone to a better startup. These counterfactuals can get complex, and we’ll discuss these considerations and their implications in more depth later in the series.

**Spillover effects**

As well as the good you can do directly as an entrepreneur by selling products that help the world, there are also likely a number of positive externalities that come from entrepreneurship, which are less immediately obvious. Innovation tends to spur more innovation, by spurring on other innovators productivity and opening up new possibilities.  For example, the invention of the first phone allowed thousand of other innovations to bloom: mobile phones, smartphones, apps, and so on. Innovation also likely has more long-run benefits through [boosting economic growth](http://www.oecd.org/cfe/tourism/34267902.pdf). We’d also expect innovation to be a big market failure, so this is a promising area in general.

**Career capital**

An extra reason for going into entrepreneurship is that, independent of all of these complexities, it’s a great way to open up future opportunities to have impact. Even if your first startup fails, or you don’t manage to do something revolutionary that changes millions of peoples’ lives, you’ll have learned a huge amount about what works and what doesn’t, and what you can do to improve next time. One of the best ways to learn about how business works is arguably just to try and do things, and get feedback from the real world. Having tried to do a startup and failed also likely looks better on your CV than you might think. And unlike many traditional salaried careers, success in entrepreneurship doesn’t depend on having elite university qualifications, so it’s much more accessible.

*"No one will blame you if the startup tanks, so long as you made a serious effort. There may once have been a time when employers would regard that as a mark against you, but they wouldn't now. I asked managers at big companies, and they all said they'd prefer to hire someone who'd tried to start a startup and failed over someone who'd spent the same time working at a big company."*

*Paul Graham, [Why to Not Not Start a Startup](http://paulgraham.com/notnot.html)*

In upcoming posts, we’ll cover:

* How to assess the impact of an entrepreneur

* Some suggestions for dealing with the personal risk involved

* How the expected earnings of entrepreneurship compare with other jobs

* Which products help the world most, and how to tell

* Whether there’s demand for more entrepreneurs

* How to become an entrepreneur, and who is best suited to it

I'd be particularly interested in knowing more about the workload (amount, type, variability or "peakiness") that is involved in entrepreneurship - the vague impression that I've got is that it's a lot of stress and a lot of work to get something running, but that's mostly anecdotal and I don't have a sense of the scale of workload compared to, say, trying to get tenure in the academic world, or the demands of tough undergraduate university programs.

- http://www.rolfnelson.com/2009/11/puzzle-failing-as-founder-seems-to.html
- http://www.rolfnelson.com/2009/11/cheat-sheet-success-factors-in-new.html

For the career capital question, it's important to compare to what you would have done otherwise. It's possible that other experiences could teach you more. Some plausible better preparations for running a startup would be:

- Work for several different existing startups. That way you get to see what processes they use which you can adopt in your own startup.
- Work somewhere that exposes you to many startups (perhaps a VC firm) so you can see patterns of success.
- Work in a particular industry. This means you can get enough experience to identify B2B needs for that particular industry.
- Get a highly technical job (e.g. in data science) that means you have the experience to build an extremely technical product.
- Get a job that involves a lot of sales, negotiation, and business development. Then become the business guy for a startup.
- Do what makeshift.io do - they start off several small projects at once. They have fixed evaluation points for each of the project at which they say 'do we turn this into a medium-term project'. And similarly they cull some of their medium term projects until they are left with only the best to carry on in the long term. One of the founders calls it 'failing in parrallel: http://sketchingwithcode.com/2013/05/16/fail-in-parallel

I'm not convinced about whether doing a startup early on when you have very little experience is the best preparation for succeeding at a startup.

You have to not only suffer from akrasia -- that is, have the rationality failure mode that Beeminder solves -- but also have a combination of personality traits that make quantified-self-based commitment devices a viable solution: a certain level of self-awareness and integrity to not just weasel out of the incentive scheme you create for yourself, and general life-hackery and data-nerdery.

Support our service.

We’re looking for donations to develop 80,000 Hours.

We set up 80,000 Hours because we believe it is our best opportunity to make the most difference in the world. There’s an enormous opportunity to help thousands or even millions of people to find the opportunities that enable them to make the most difference.

We’re looking for £360,000 to develop our content over the next two years, test to see if it works, and, if it works, prepare to take it to scale. During that time, we also anticipate carrying out hundreds of in-depth consulting sessions with the most high potential, altruistic young people in the world, spinning off high impact projects and raising millions for charity.

If you would like to talk to someone about donating, please contact development AT 80000hours.org.

You can see more details on what we have done and our plans on our [evaluation pages](http://80000hours.org/blog/251-summary-of-our-six-month-evaluation).

If you would like to donate now, please go [here](http://home.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/donate/80k).



##What can your donations buy?

Over 80% of our budget is for our staff. So extra donations mainly allow us to maintain and grow the team. We think our team represents exceptional value. It’s made up of highly able, dedicated people, who care a great deal about the impact they have in the world, and so work for less than they could make even at other non-profits.

* An extra £100 allows us to talk to 5 people one-on-one about their plans.

* An extra £500 enables us to do a full [case study](http://80000hours.org/blog/232-we-re-changing-our-career-coaching).

* An extra £1,000 enables us to host a graduate volunteer to do a month of research, including all overhead. In this time they could do projects like creating a framework for comparing two important options, such as research and earning to give, they could interview experts about promising talent gaps, or they could survey empirical data on important questions, like expected earnings estimates.

* An extra £25,000 enables us to hire an extra full time researcher or careers coach for a year, including all overhead. They could do something like deliver 50 in-depth case studies.

For more information on our budget, please see [our latest finance report](http://80000hours.org/blog/249-finance-report).


##What kind of return have you earned with donations in the past?

In only a year we have taken 80,000 Hours from a volunteer run student society to a professional organisation with 8 full-time staff that’s hosted within Oxford University offices.

Our key focus has been rapidly learning about what business model to pursue and what content to create. We think we have been successful in this aim, and have taken [our strategy through several major iterations](http://80000hours.org/blog/246-our-progress).

Despite not being our focus, we’ve had strong success in outreach. Web traffic took off after we started full time:

<a href='http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eightythousand/posts/images/225/original/image_0.png?1379515036'><img alt="Image_0" class="image large" src="http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eightythousand/posts/images/225/large/image_0.png?1379515036" /></a>

This led to growing membership about seven-fold from 120 in July 2012 to 1000 today.

<a href='http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eightythousand/posts/images/224/original/1000.png?1379448824'><img alt="1000" class="image large" src="http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eightythousand/posts/images/224/large/1000.png?1379448824" /></a>

In terms of charitable donations alone, we expect to have raised many times our costs on behalf of top charities. In addition we have:

*Received major media coverage*

We have been mentioned in The Washington Post, The New York Times, BBC Today Programme, The Daily Mail, CNBC, NPR, Quartz, and in Peter Singer's TED talk.

*Produced substantial content*

We’ve published over 100 blog posts, given one-on-one advice to over 100 people, and have published an article in a major philosophy journal.

*Contributed to creating a network of alumni and projects*

This period, Effective Animal Activism hired an Executive Director and was spun-off. We’ve begun talking to a group of top entrepreneurs about starting an incubator. We’ve seen several 80k alumni each donate over $80,000 in their first year alone, and enter jobs at Google, McKinsey, Jane St and Rothschild. 

*Completed key organisational set up*

We’ve grown from being a volunteer team to a professional organisation with 8 full-time staff and Oxford University offices in a just a year. We’ve also completed key legal set up.


For more on our cost-effectiveness, please see [our recent evaluation of 80,000 Hours as a project](http://80000hours.org/blog/248-evaluation-of-80-000-hours-as-project).


##Why do you think this project is high impact?

###The benefits

We’re the only people in the world who are systematically investigating the best opportunities for individuals to make a difference.

By preparing and delivering this information, we’ll have the potential to bring thousands of extra people to work on the most high priority opportunities in the world.

If our model works, it will be extremely cost-effective. 80,000 Hours will act as a multiplier on the resources going into whichever opportunity is best at the time. For instance, suppose we identify a promising idea for a new non-profit. We find someone better qualified than ourselves to take that position. Our team has less than 10 people, but we have the potential to help at least hundreds of other people enter the best opportunities.

An investment in us now enables us to transparently explore this possibility of having huge leverage to see if it really works. If it does, we’ll be able to massively scale it up, since the issue of which careers make the most difference is of interest to a large fraction of young graduates (for instance, see [this survey](http://80000hours.org/blog/108-net-impact-survey-hopeful-news-for-ethical-careers)) and no-one else is doing anything like this.

In addition, over the next two years, we anticipate the following extra benefits:
* Raise more than our costs in donations to top funding opportunities through promoting earning to give
* Do in-depth research to help the career decisions of at least 100 of the most altruistic, most high potential people we can find
* Prepare over a hundred research reports on which careers are best and how to choose them
* Build connections within the effective altruism community and promote the key ideas of effective altruism

For more detail on our plans, please see [here](http://80000hours.org/blog/250-team-plan)


###The evidence

In addition to the strength of the concept, we think the following strands support our case:

*(1) Success to date*

We have been successful in rapidly growing an effective, well managed organisation with a highly motivated team in very little time. 

We think this team has been successful in rapidly learning about which approaches work and adapting our strategy based on the evidence. In the last year, we have made four rounds of improvement to our strategy.

Further, we had significant outreach success, which gives us confidence that our model can work. For instance:
* We have been able to generate major press coverage for our ideas, including Peter Singer’s TED talk about effective altruism, Will MacAskill’s column on Qz.com and press coverage of [earning to give](80000hours.org/media).
* We have been able to significantly increase the the number of visits to our site, from about 2,500 unique visits per month in July 2012 to over 8,000 today.
* This has led to significant demand for our case studies. We now turn away over 90% of requests.
* We have had exponential membership growth to 1000 members, and over 10% of these say they anticipate significantly or completely changing their career because of 80,000 Hours.
* By working with people in-depth in the past, we have led to dramatic career changes. For more, see [our business plan](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-Jhoc5Aa_5WU09CcU1Sb254NlU/edit?usp=sharing). This includes several people choosing to pursue earning to give and donating tens of thousands of dollars to effective charities.
* We have already been able to help fill some high priority career opportunities by finding a trial hire for GiveWell, a staff member for Giving What We Can and a staff member for the Future of Humanity Institute.
* We have already spun-off an [entirely new charity operating in a high priority area](www.effectiveanimalactivism.org).


For more details on what we’ve achieved and what mistakes we have made, see our [evaluation](http://80000hours.org/blog/248-evaluation-of-80-000-hours-as-project).


*(2) The base rate*

We think we operate at the intersection of several broad promising areas, which increases our confidence about our impact to date and the promise of our model.

1. As we will argue in an upcoming post, we think cause prioritisation is a highly promising area. 80,000 Hours contributes directly to cause prioritisation by carrying out and collating career prioritisation research.

2. We’re part of the effective altruism movement, which is itself growing very rapidly and has produced highly cost-effective projects like GiveWell, which we aim to model ourselves on.

3. On average, it’s [easy](http://80000hours.org/blog/92-why-don-t-charities-spend-more-on-fundraising) to raise more than $1 for charity per $1 spent fundraising. An element of what we do is fundraising for effective charities. The rest of what we do is analogous to fundraising except it involves human capital.


*(3) The team*

You pay for a [highly able team](/meet-the-team) at a very low price. Our staff work for lower wages than they could receive elsewhere, even in the non-profit sector, because their core aim is making the most difference.


*(4) Our motivations*

We’re working on this project because we think it’s one of the best ways for us to make a difference in the world. We hold ourselves to high standards of evidence, and if we don’t think what we do works, we’ll either change it or scale back the project.


*(5) The market niche*
 
We think there’s a clear case of a market niche. There’s strong and growing demand for careers with a social impact among young people.[^1] But there’s little guidance as to what’s best. The few ethical careers services that exist (ethicalcareers.org; ethicaljobs.net; ethical-jobs.co.uk) are small and often superficial in their advice, lacking key considerations such as those listed [here](http://80000hours.org/our-features). Moreover, people are dissatisfied with careers advice in general: our survey found that only 15% of students in Oxford find existing careers services “very useful” and we’ve been able to generate substantial interest in our alternative careers service in little time.

What are you going to do with your life?

If you’re like most young people, you care about making a difference. But who’s there to help you with that? So much of the career advice out there today is unhelpful cliches. Here’s some of the most common career advice we’ve found over the last six months that you shouldn’t follow.


1\. **Do what you’re passionate about**

Perhaps the most common advice of all. It’s espoused by hundreds of advice gurus and public figures, perhaps most famously Steve Jobs, who told the Stanford class of ‘05 *”you’ve got to find what you love”*, in a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc) that has gone on to have over 16 million views.

But when Jobs was young, his passions were history, dance and eastern mysticism. Is that what he should have done? He first got into computers as a way to earn cash on the side.

This advice gets things backwards, since passion develops out of applying yourself to something worthwhile. It’s not helpful to think that your passion is out there, waiting to be discovered. You create your passion.

We’ve already offered a comprehensive take-down [here](http://80000hours.org/blog/62-don-t-do-what-you-re-passionate-about-part-1).


2\. **Do what you’re good at**

Better, but consider, I’m amazingly good at meat packing. Is that what I should do? This advice is incomplete at best. 

And similar to ‘do what you’re passionate about’, it gets things backwards. Getting good at something is the result of thousands of hours of practice. So, your choice of career is *more* a choice of ‘what should I get good at?’ rather than ‘what am I already good at?’


In part, these two slogans go wrong because they’re too inwards facing - they don’t consider *what the world needs*, even though this is clearly important in itself, *and* working on something valuable is the key to a meaningful career.

But people who want to focus on *contributing* face another slew of bad advice. For instance:


3\. **Work in a non-profit**

People interested in leading a career that makes the world a better place are often encouraged into the non-profit sector (or else the public sector). This is evident in the UK in the ‘ethical careers’ movement, led by books like *The Ethical Careers Guide*, which prominently features a variety of non-profit jobs as ‘ethical careers.’

Working at a non-profit can be a great way to make a difference. But it’s no guarantee. Amazingly, lots of non-profits probably have [**no**](http://80000hours.org/blog/66-social-interventions-gone-wrong) [**impact**](http://80000hours.org/blog/100-let-s-stop-building-schools). And do workers at non-profit have more impact than [the people](/earning-to-give) who fund them? The researchers who push forward progress? The entrepreneurs who transform the economy? Policy makers? Maybe. No one stops to ask.

Further, even if the non-profit itself has an impact, if it has a lot of people who want to work for it, then your individual contribution might be relatively small. You’ll just be taking the job from [someone else]((http://80000hours.org/blog/35-the-replaceability-effect-working-in-unethical-industries-part-1).


4\. **Avoid ‘bad’ industries**

As well as being encouraged into the non-profit sector, one is pushed away from the ‘bad’ industries. Don’t work in finance, law or advertising. 

But this is clearly an oversimplified message. Not every job in finance is obviously bad. And there’s a difference between the harm done by an industry and the harm done by an individual working in the [industry](http://80000hours.org/blog/35-the-replaceability-effect-working-in-unethical-industries-part-1). Moreover, this advice ignores the potential one has to use these positions for good, either by receiving valuable training, an influential network or lots of money that can be used to fund good causes.

Perversely, since this advice is widely believed, bad industries can offer *more* opportunities for having a real impact. If people with good motivations become less inclined to take these positions, then you’d expect there to be more un-taken opportunities left lying around to make a difference. This is certainly the case with donating money, with the rich donating a [*smaller*](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/04/why-the-rich-dont-give/309254/) fraction of their income to charity than the average.


5\. **Follow your values**

Better again. But it’s still just the beginning. This advice is frequently offered, and has some alternative forms like ‘follow your heart’ or ‘do what’s right.’ But it’s normally offered without an appreciation of how hard it actually is to work out your values in the first place, or any of the information you’d need to do so. After all, there’s an entire academic discipline dedicated to the study of creating a good value system (ethics), which doesn’t offer many easy answers.

As an example, consider the following advice: “Write out a list of organisations you feel do good. Try to briefly define what good was done. What themes emerge?” Suppose what comes to mind are a bunch of organisations that plant trees to reduce climate change. Is ‘helping the environment by planting foliage’ what I ultimately value and should devote my career to? Frequently, this is as far as we go. But if you really think about it, there will be other things you care about. For instance, if you could cover part of Africa in forest at the cost of causing a huge famine, would you do it? 

In reality, there are many tough trade-offs to make. Donating $2000 to a charity planting trees, means an [extra person](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#Costperlifesaved) dies of malaria. Brushing the trade-offs aside is not acceptable.

Finding advice like this is our motivation for setting up 80,000 Hours. We want to develop the best advice out there on how to make an impact with your career.

Over the next six months, we’ll be publishing a complete package of material on our site to get you started on leading a high impact career, which we hope will start to overcome these cliches.

But before that, we want to know exactly what your sticking points are. What’s the worst advice you’ve received? What have you tried and failed? If you could change one thing about your career, what would it be?

Highlights our main achievements and mistakes in the period.

* Our key priority was further developing our business model and content plans, and we’re pleased with our success in this area. We made two rounds of improvements, culminating with adopting the ‘[case study model](http://80000hours.org/blog/232-we-re-changing-our-career-coaching)’ - we outline our key ideas then do further research by doing in-depth consultations on the career decisions of high potential people.

* Our next major priority was further building 80,000 Hours and the Centre for Effective Altruism as robust, effective organisations. We made mistakes in this area, but overall I think we made strong progress. We successfully coped with almost a doubling of the number of people working at the Centre for Effective Altruism.

* While prioritising developing our business model and organisation building, we’ve also performed strongly in outreach and content. Increasing web traffic by 47% and recruiting about 400 new members was well ahead of expectations.

* We made many mistakes this period, but I’d classify most as minor mistakes or just ways things could have gone better. The worst mistake was that the operations team ran out of capacity in March, slowing down our overall progress.

* We believe it’s likely but highly uncertain that our current business model and content is effective relative to GiveWell’s top recommendations, and we continue to rapidly improve our business model.

* We continue to learn about how to function effectively as an organisation (as explained in [Our Progress](http://drive.google.com/open?id=1piKbNzsRK3ZY19fKtbGma4cHzCR_Bjpg-W8UDCNtSm8)). One significant challenge ahead is learning how to effectively run a larger, three tier organisation.

* We continue to rely heavily on our key staff, though we’re making progress towards reducing this reliance.

* We’re not financially weak, but there is significant room to become more secure.

* Our team is highly able and reports high levels of satisfaction, and we’re attracting very talented applicants, especially to our internships. Nevertheless, we are being somewhat slowed down by not being able to find enough talented staff.

Evaluates the effectiveness of our model to date.

[(5) Our Plans for the Next Six Months](http://80000hours.org/blog/250-team-plan)

* We continue to see the top priority as further investment i.e. developing our business model, content and the organisation’s robustness.

* The flagship goal in this area is carrying out 30 case studies, which will form the centre of our content and evaluation efforts.

* Also important is: (i) more impact evaluation in general (ii) fundraising enough to keep up with our expanding budget (iii) increasing our talent pool through training and outreach (iv) increase the appeal of our content to successful young professionals through rebranding (v) having high quality research on our key ideas to support the case studies.

* Outreach is less high priority, except insofar as we do enough to ensure a strong stream of candidates for case studies and internships, and build up credibility (e.g. receiving press coverage, impressive affiliations).

* We’re also not yet focused on scaling up delivery, because we think it will be overall faster to spend more time developing our content at this stage.

[(6) Finance Report](http://80000hours.org/blog/249-finance-report)

* We spent £79,000 last year, which paid for about 2.7 full-time staff and 4.7 full-time interns.

* 85% of our budget was spent on staff salaries and intern expenses. The majority of the remainder is spent on office costs.

* Our central projection is to spend £160,000 over the following year

* We have £30,000 of cash on hand, which is two months of reserves. Our target is to have at least six months of reserves.

* Our room for funding over the next 12 months is at least £360,000.

Gives an overview of our current programs, impact model, impact tracking approach, funding model and 2-5 year expansion plans.

* Our ultimate aim is to do the most good by promoting the community that supports effective altruism.

* The key problem we address is: People don’t have enough access to high quality information on how to make a difference with their productive time.

* Our Vision: The most high potential people in the world are taking the most high impact opportunities to make a difference.

* Our Mission: Move the most high potential people into the world’s most pressing talent gaps.

##Introduction

Several months ago, we [wrote about](http://80000hours.org/blog/162-how-to-create-the-world-s-most-effective-charity) an apparently easy way to create a charity that’s more effective than [GiveWell’s](www.givewell.org) top recommendations. It’s a simple idea: create an organisation that does nothing except  fundraise for GiveWell’s top recommendations. It [seems relatively easy](http://80000hours.org/blog/92-why-don-t-charities-spend-more-on-fundraising) to raise more than $1 for every $1 invested in fundraising, so it seems relatively easy to act as a multiplier on donations to other charities, and thus create an organisation with a cost-effectiveness ratio that’s higher than the charities themselves. 

The idea has merit from other angles too, for instance, [there’s reason to expect](http://80000hours.org/blog/92-why-don-t-charities-spend-more-on-fundraising) that charities don’t fundraise as much as would be optimal, and it’s a valuable service to them to take fundraising off their books. It’s also promising because the success of fundraising is relatively easy to quantify compared to many other meta-charity activities (like doing research or advocacy). This means that you can learn quickly whether you’re succeeding, which means you can improve quickly.

We were thrilled, therefore, to find that two 80k members, Joey and Xio, are planning to start an organisation that does exactly this. It’s called [Effective Fundraising](http://www.effectivefundraising.net/). Their plan is to start by writing grants for [Against Malaria Foundation](http://www.againstmalaria.com/) (AMF) and [The Humane League](http://www.thehumaneleague.com/) for six months. If it goes well, they could hire more people. Longer term, they could expand into others kinds of fundraising. They chose grant writing because (i) surveys of average fundraising ratios found that grant writing earns an average return of around $8 for every $1 invested, which is higher than most other forms of fundraising (ii) the money can be raised within 6-18 months, unlike ‘chugging’ (asking for donations on the street) or door-to-door which takes several years to pay off.

Joey and Xio sought out a huge amount of advice on their strategy. They’re some of the most altruistic people we know, and recently put college on hold in Canada in order to work on effective altruist start-ups. One of the sources they consulted was 80,000 Hours, and we were very happy to help. Rob Wiblin and I spent several hours thinking about their strategy and several hours discussing with Joey and Xio. (They have also sought advice from the other employees of 80,000 Hours and our President, Will MacAskill).

Joey and Xio were mainly seeking advice on how best to execute the project. In the rest of this post, we outline the main recommendations we made during the course of the discussion. Although our discussions didn’t lead to an immediate change in their plans, we hope this contributes to the discussion that Joey and Xio have been leading on how best to fundraise for top GiveWell recommendations, and inspires others to consider similar ways to make a difference. In summary:

## Summary

We think:

1. Working on Effective Fundraising looks like a very strong option for building career capital.
2. They could consider running more experiments before committing to grant-writing for 6 months.
3. They may be having less impact than they could because they may not be supporting the most high priority causes.
4. They should strongly consider hiring someone else to work for Effective Fundraising as a grant writer.


### (1) We agree that working on Effective Fundraising looks like a very strong option for building career capital

By founding their own organisation, we expect them to learn a variety of very useful entrepreneurial skills very rapidly. They should also improve their ability to fundraise, which is a highly useful skill for someone looking to work in the non-profit sector, but also involves sales skills that are useful almost everywhere.

This seems better than the skill development they could have working at another effective altruist organisation, where they would probably be given less responsibility, particularly if they make sure they prioritise learning while running Effective Fundraising (which they are).

In addition, Effective Fundraising offers more long-term upside. If it works, it could grow into large, new organisation within effective altruism.


### (2) They could consider running more experiments before committing to grant-writing for 6 months.

We both agree that it’s very important to test this project before scaling it up. We place higher weight on this factor than Joey and Xio, because because we think:
1. There’s a large amount of uncertainty about much money they might expect to raise with different methods
2. It seems relatively easy to learn more about how much money they might expect to raise by trying out different methods for a couple of months each.
3. This information would be very valuable, because it could significantly improve how they spend a year of effort, and the information would be valuable to other effective altruists considering the same thing.

Moreover, we think testing grant writing has lower value of information than testing other fundraising, because the feedback is weak. 

First, grant writing often has low success ratios. If your base rate of success is only 5%, then you will need to write a lot of grants to measure your ratio. We did a quick analysis, assuming that you have a 50% chance of being as good as professional grant writers (who we modelled as having three levels of ability, based on [Institute of Fundraising](http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/research/fundratios/) (IoF) data and assuming a base rate of success of 5%), and a 50% chance of not being able to raise money via grant-writing. We then asked: how many attempts would you have to make before you can be confident that grant writing is better than a guaranteed 3 times pay-off? Assuming a binomial distribution on successes, and performing a bayesian update, we found:
* It would take 47 failures in a row to become 90% confident that grant writing is worse
* It would take 13 failures in a row for the expected value of grant writing to drop below a guaranteed 3 times return.
* On the other hand, 2-3 successes out of the first 5 or so would push grant writing strongly ahead.
(You can see the spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuJhoc5Aa_5WdGF2TEpNSVJacFJZeTQ1TkktMGhKSUE#gid=7))

Second, you have to wait 6-12 months to hear the results.

Note that both of these concerns can be mitigated to some extent by starting with easy grants that have close deadlines.

Joey and Xio, however, think that the reasons behind grant writing are sufficiently strong that they should start immediately and do it for six months as a test. In particular they respond:

* The uncertainty is less than made out, because there is some data provided by the IoF on the returns of different methods. In particular, the average grant-writer makes 8 times their salary, and the bottom 15% make 5 times their salary. So, even if they perform at the bottom of grant writers, it will be better to do grant-writing than most other forms of fundraising.
* It’s harder to experiment than it looks. “You need licenses to do door-to-door fundraising and street fundraising, and it takes years for you to determine if the recurring donations have a good ratio. Legacies take several years, and sometimes decades to see returns. Both corporate and high net worth donors take considerable time to learn the field and become good at. In 6 months it might be possible to sufficiently test one of these. We think the data, while not as strong as we would like, is enough to show that grant writing is promising, and that it is worth a six to twelve month test.”

We note some countervailing considerations:
* It’s unclear how good the Institute of Fundraising data is, because they don’t publish their methods. For instance, they may not correct for survivorship bias - maybe fundraisers who don’t succeed don’t survive till the end of the year, so don’t appear in the data as collected. We’d also expect the figures to be systematically overstated, because charities have an incentive to keep fundraising costs low, so will try to put fundraising costs under different budget lines (moreover, this seems easier to do with grant writing or high net-worth fundraising than with chugging, because much grant writing is done by managers who have other responsibilities).
* The IoF data seems to be *the returns earned by people who currently work as grant-writers.* Grant-writers who earn less than 5 times their salary lose their jobs very quickly, so the data *obviously* shows that the ratios are higher than 5 times. This information doesn’t tell us much about how much money Joey and Xio might expect to earn by grant-writing.
* There are reasons to expect Joey and Xio will earn less. The average grant-writer is paid over £30,000 per year, which is a professional salary and probably equivalent to something like earning £60,000 in the corporate sector. This suggests that it’s a competitive field. On the other hand, this might be balanced out by the fact that (i) Against Malaria Foundation should be relatively easy to fundraise for (ii) Joey and Xio will prioritise learning and feedback so that they improve at grant writing as quickly as possible.
* Even if the licenses for other types of fundraising take several days of full-time work to get, it will still be worth it. Moreover, there seem to be ways to do tests without a license, for instance, you don’t collect payment details and instead just collect pledges for donations and email addresses.

In the end, we didn’t reach agreement. Joey and Xio still intend to commit to grant writing, while we suspect it may be better to prioritise experimentation slightly higher.


### (3) They may be having less impact than they could because they may not be supporting the most high priority causes.

We agree that supporting GiveWell recommendations is highly valuable and that the project has an attractive flexibility, since (to some extent) it will be possible to fundraise for different organisations as the evidence changes.

We think, however, that AMF and The Humane League might not be the most promising uses of money currently available, so Joey and Xio might be able to increase expected returns by funding someone else.

Joey and Xio’s response is that: They are a fundraising organization, not a charity evaluation organization. They take top recommendations from Givewell and Effective Animal Activism, two of the most recognized charity evaluators in their respective fields.

We think that going with GiveWell’s recommendations is a reasonable move as it’s plausibly the best charity evaluator in the world, but we also think it’s worth putting more effort into the decision if your aim is really to maximise expected returns. 

First, many leading experts both within and outside of effective altruism don’t think that GiveWell’s recommendations clearly offer the best returns. As three examples within global poverty, IPA, AidGrade and Giving What We Can are experts on evidence-based aid, and they don’t fully agree with GiveWell although there is overlap (see [here](http://www.poverty-action.org/provenimpact/testedandproven), [here](http://www.aidgrade.org/uncategorized/some-friendly-concerns-with-givewell) and [here](http://givingwhatwecan.org/where-to-give/recommended-charities)). Disagreements are even larger if you also consider charities outside the global poverty cause.


More importantly, *even GiveWell* [don’t claim](http://www.givewell.org/criteria) that giving to AMF is generically the use of money with the highest expected return. Rather they claim that it’s the best donation opportunity to an existing organisation that’s proven, scalable, has room for more funding and is transparent enough that uninvolved third parties can see that it is. This leaves open the possibility that there are organisations that might be more effective to fund, work for or set up:
1. Unproven organisations - these could worth investing in (a) to gain information about what works or (b) because they offer high expected return despite low certainty.
2. Organisations that Joey and Xio have special insight into not available to GiveWell.
3. Organisations that Joey and Xio could support to gain valuable information about what works that wouldn’t give GiveWell the same level of information.
4. Small organisations (if room for more funding is less than several hundred thousand dollars, GiveWell won’t normally investigate them, though [there are reasons](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/04/18/challenges-of-passive-funding/) to think many of these opportunities are taken, at least outside of meta-charity style projects).
5. Organisations that don’t exist yet, but could be created if a donor expressed interest in them or a credible entrepreneur started them. GiveWell has suggested that the approach of strategically picking a cause and then being an [active donor](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/04/18/challenges-of-passive-funding/) could yield better results, at least in some cases.
6. Organisations that GiveWell hasn’t had time to investigate yet.
7. Organisations that don’t share GiveWell’s values (e.g. GiveWell doesn’t currently factor animal welfare into their evaluation).
Going with GiveWell recommendations means ignoring opportunities to support organisations that fall into these categories, which plausibly contain organisations that are higher impact.

*Note that after this post was written, Holden replied (see the comments below), stating that GiveWell does believe that giving to AMF is currently the charitable donation opportunity with the highest expected return, in contraction to the statement above*

One response could be that making calls like this is difficult, so it’s better just to stick with GiveWell. But Joey and Xio have already decided to funnel 50% of the funds raised to Effective Animal Activism’s top recommendation, which has to date invested far less research time than GiveWell in charity evaluation. It seems inconsistent to overrule GiveWell in this case but not in the other cases.

As an aside, note that if you think that the best opportunities will typically be in these categories, then the idea of Effective Fundraising is slightly less attractive, because opportunities like these are typically difficult to fundraise for as an outsider (and seem easier to support through direct work or earning to give). We think it’s plausible that the best opportunities in these categories will often be more attractive than proven, scalable charities, because (i) value of information is very important because we’re highly uncertain what’s best and opportunities like this offer more information about what works (ii) being an [active donor](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/04/18/challenges-of-passive-funding/) or entrepreneur opens up the space of projects a great deal, which increases the chance finding a good one provided you have a search strategy that’s somewhat effective (iii) [broad market efficiency](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/) - if it has already been recognized by GiveWell, then it willl be attracting the attention of some major funders.


### (4)  They should strongly consider hiring someone else to work for Effective Fundraising as a grant writer.

Employing someone to write grants for AMF seems like a good use of money, but it’s something that you don’t need an effective altruist to do. Rather, it might be better to find a grant writer with a track record of several years and ask them to write the grants. This seems more proven and likely to result in higher returns more quickly. The fundraiser could also be paid partially on commission, reducing the downside to Effective Fundraising. This would free Joey and Xio up to work on projects that are less easy to outsource. Or, at least it could help them learn to grant write quicker. I offered to help them raise money to pay for such a person.

Joey and Xio raised some important additional points:
1. It would be difficult to raise the money, especially if they don’t want it to take funds away from effective charities.
2. It’s too risky - they prefer to trial the project themselves before scaling up.
3. They’re worried an external fundraiser might not be effectiveness oriented, which would make the organisation less flexible.
4. They did not feel an external fundraiser, costing three times their combined salary, would likely raise 6 times more per hour than they would.

We agree (1) and (3) are concerns, though don’t seem to sink the idea. Rather, it would be better to make some tests to see if (1) and (3) are true.

(4) is not the relevant comparison. First, what matters is marginal effectiveness not average effectiveness. Even if the extra fundraiser has a lower fundraising ratio, it could still be worth hiring them because it increases the total impact. Second, the ratio of money raised to salary is not what’s relevant from the perspective of maximising impact. Joey and Xio are happy to work on impressively low salaries, which boosts the headline cost-effectiveness of Effective Fundraising, but their opportunity cost also matters. Joey and Xio may have a higher opportunity cost than a fundraiser, because they may have the option to work on another highly effective project.

(2) also doesn’t seem right. If Joey and Xio try to write grants for AMF and fail, then we haven’t learned that Effective Fundraising is a bad idea. Rather, we’ve just learned that Joey and Xio shouldn’t write grants. In this case, it seems like you’d still want to find someone else to try to write grants for AMF. If Joey and Xio try to write grants for AMF and succeed, then they’ll want to hire someone else to scale up. Either way, they’ll want to someone else to be employed as a grant writer, and delaying that process is just slowing down moving money to AMF. Moreover, it seems that it’s less risky to hire a professional with a track record than to do grant writing themselves.

We didn’t reach agreement and Joey and Xio intend to delay hiring another staff member for at least 6 months.

"If Joey and Xio try to write grants for AMF and fail, then we haven’t learned that Effective Fundraising is a bad idea. Rather, we’ve just learned that Joey and Xio shouldn’t write grants. In this case, it seems like you’d still want to find someone else to try to write grants for AMF."

This doesn't seem right to me. If six months of full-time work by two effective altruists doesn't yield reasonable returns, I think that should cause a significant update in the direction of "Effective Fundraising is a bad idea." I think we disagree because your toy model with a base rate of 5% chance of success but heterogenous grant writing talent doesn't strike me as very realistic. My understanding of the charity sector is that "grant writing appears to be a cheap way to raise funds" because writing grants is easy relative to the magnitudes of money involved and doesn't matter much, not because marginal increases in grant writing capacity will lead to proportional increases in funding. My model of foundations is that actual grant applications are normally a formality that cement an already-planned grant, and that grant writing is mostly a tax on non-profits. However, I'm not highly confident in that model, and I could readily update if Effective Altruism succeeds in raising funds via their grant writing efforts, so I'm excited that they're trying.

If Effective Fundraising fails to raise a considerable amount of money, then I think it's a mistake to update more in favor of "Joey and Xio shouldn’t write grants" than in favor of "our model of how grant writing works is wrong," especially in light of the low quality of the evidence used to justify investment in grant writing and, IMO, the relatively limited evidence for important differences in grant-writer quality. A low base rate would be a problem, but in that case I'd like to see better evidence about why we should expect a base rate as low as 5%, which I don't see a citation for and strikes me as too low.

This could be interpreted as an argument against focusing on grant-writing so completely so early, but I do expect the base rate to be relatively low, so a 6 month period of focus on one approach does not strike me as unwarranted. The same kinds of uncertainty might well surround other fundraising techniques, so picking one to pilot for a several month period and then reassess strikes me as a good strategic choice.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1328</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Benjamin Todd</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>benjamin.john.todd@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/benjamin-todd</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-09-16 17:40:55</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In reply to Alexander, having thought about this further, you've updated me towards failure after 6 months meaning "grant writing is not such a good idea", but I'd still lean towards "someone else should do grant writing" overall.

If we knew of better giving opportunities, we would publish them.

It's true that we believe better giving opportunities probably <em>exist</em>, and we started <a href="http://www.givewell.org/givewell-labs">GiveWell Labs</a> in order to find them. But we expect this to be a long and difficult road. We believe that being an active donor, supporting small unproven organizations, etc. is a higher degree of difficulty than supporting proven organizations, so we think it's not good advice to suggest that a small number of people running a part-time project pursue this approach rather than taking our recommendations.

Of course, it's always possible that a given person has connections, context and knowledge that we don't that leads to being able to spot a particular superior giving opportunity. But given that we are a full-time, multiple-staff operation devoted to finding the best giving opportunities we can, and Effective Fundraising is a part-time operation with a different primary goal, we don't understand the argument that Effective Fundraising should be trying - in addition to its primary goal - to do a better job than we are at our primary goal.

On another note, some of Elie's thoughts on the basic approach are available https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XYtWXc5__oZyq-_H8QJbY4ShbV_Az4Azerb2yfC0od0/ in the transcript of a conversation he had with Rob Wiblin (linked from http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-07-30/givewell-interview-on-causes-outside-global-health-givewell-labs-and-fundraising)

There is a conflict here, though -- really you want to get a very good grant-writer, and they may not be the ones in search of jobs.

I actually think that it might be best to try to hire a top grant writer to consult for them for a relatively short period. They could get this person to read over draft grant proposals they've made and make comments. This would probably improve the quality of the grant proposal (and so increase likelihood of funding), but it would also help Xio and Joey to learn high quality grant writing faster. I think this latter effect could be more important than the former.

Berger and Karnofsky above, I don't understand why Messrs. Todd and Wiblin would suggest that Effective Fundraising consider fundraising for other causes, when other organizations of effective altruism scarcely know how to identify what those causes might be. Unless a strongly reasoned consensus of the other charity evaluators such as Giving What We Can that Mr. Todd has cited above recommend poverty-reduction charities other than AMF. Alternatively, they could fundraise for organizations trying to reduce catastrophic or existential risks, yet it seems to me that the effects of such organizations are too far from settled or uncontroversial to warrant them being the target of Effective Fundraising's initial efforts. Also, as an aside, my intuition is that fundraising for existential or catastrophic risk reduction would be so different than fundraising for conventional charitable causes that an entirely different approach to it ought to be considered.

I do agree with Messrs. Todd and Wiblin that Effective Fundraising should perhaps be more wary of raising so much in terms of funds for EAA's top recommended charities, and experiment with different methods of fundraising. However, I don't know what to suggest those methods should be. Anyway, it seems to me such a strategy follows the maxim of 'if you're going to fail, fail hard and fast', so that effective altruism as a movement can learn what will and will not work in terms of fundraising, and learn how realistic the possibility of massive payoff from fundraising is.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1321</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Florent Berthet</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>florent.berthet@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/florent-berthet</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-09-13 17:06:17</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree with Evan.

As a french EA who is considering doing the same thing in my country, I need to know as soon as possible whether this strategy is effective and how to improve it.

On “6 month period of focus on one approach does not strike me as unwarranted”. We agree and have written a further post here on how long we think (in very rough approximations) it would take to experiment with different methods of fundraising. 
http://www.effectivefundraising.net/1/post/2013/09/why-did-we-choose-grant-writing.html
In summary we feel it would take around six months or more to test any one type of fundraising, and it seems like strong usable information would not be gathered from a 1 month short test. In general most fundraising takes time to get good at and works better if you put more time into it/researching it. We feel testing several methods would yield both weak and unreflective long term representations of all the types tested.

We would be open to more well researched and well grounded suggestions on how to test different types of fundraising faster as this interests us greatly.

On “hiring someone” we think this is the strongest above suggestion and did consider it. One factor that moved us strongly towards not hiring someone with experience (at this time) is the large amount of free help we have received from fundraisers and grant writers, including reading over draft grant proposals and making comments. It has improved the quality of the grants and It has helped us learn. We think this help has carried most if not all of the benefits I imagined would be gained by hiring someone (without tripling our operating costs) and are very happy to have this help.

On not supporting the most priority causes, it seem that  either 80,000 hours has more confidence in our ability to evaluate and choose charities then they do Givewell’s (which seems clearly false). Or they personally disagree with AMF being the highest value cause in which case I would love to see detailed evidence based discussions with an organization that works full time on this issue such as Givewell. ]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1324</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Benjamin Todd</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>benjamin.john.todd@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/benjamin-todd</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-09-15 22:46:27</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[1. One potential confusion that might be being made in several of these posts is equating "finding the best (charity) donation opportunity" with "supporting the best cause." Supporting causes is broader than giving money, because it also includes (for instance) what you do with your labor, which includes a much broader range of plausibly good options in potentially more high priority causes than global health e.g. with your labor you can start a new organisation, which you can't do as a passive donor (we'll be writing about which causes are most high priority in the future).

Whether it's better for Joey and Xio to support something more uncertain in another cause is very uncertain, but I think the question could be worth more work. Cases do exist e.g. I think it's better for me to work at 80k than to devote myself to getting money for AMF.

(note that you could argue EF's main value is supporting the cause of effective altruism because it acts as a proof of concept for an effective altruist idea, but this is not the argument Joey and Xio seem to have taken)

A related issue is the value of money given to charity vs the value of time spent working on activities not designed to raise money. Holden said in an interview with us that:
"My intuition is that a really high fraction of the good that you accomplish with your career is the actual work that you are doing. When I think about the good done by a software company, I first and foremost think about what software does for the world, not about how much one will make and can give to charity, although that’s important too."
http://80000hours.org/blog/172-interview-with-holden-karnofsky-co-founder-of-givewell

Joey and Xio will hopefully raise more money via fundraising than via earning to give, but if it's unclear that money donated via earning to give is more important than the value of your direct work in a productive sector, then it seems like it's also uncertain (though more likely) that the value of money fundraised is higher than the value of the direct work in a productive sector.

2. Restricting ourselves just to giving opportunities (rather than supporting causes in general), my main point was that Joey and Xio were being inconsistent by overruling GiveWell in the case of The Humane League but not for the other types of exception that seem about equally reasonable e.g. if you're less sceptical than GiveWell you could go with Project Healthy Children instead of AMF.

3. Thanks Alexander - I don't have a solid model of grant writing and those comments strike me as reasonable.

Why this has likely happened is because this post comes across as 80k’s main recommendations to Effective Fundraising, and the important question relative to fundraising is what the best donation opportunity is. The example of you working for 80k is irrelevant to an organization aiming to fundraise, unless you think one should fundraise for 80,000 Hours as an organization, or shut down and spend our time on something different, both of which are much stronger claims.

Likewise on “money given to charity vs the value of time spent working” this seems to be a claim less specific to effective fundraising as an organization and more specific to weather one should look at money moved or some other metric to measure positive impact on the world. If 80k has an evidence based framework to compare jobs in the productive sector I would be very interested to see it.

I find it interesting that two of the recommendations 80k gives in the supporting the best cause section is 1) Not to solely go with GiveWell’s recommendation, and 2) That going with The Humane League is not following GiveWell’s recommendations. THL seems to fall clearly under the suggested section of "Organisations that GiveWell hasn’t had time to investigate yet.".

We have mentioned why we support two different charities in two cause areas here
http://www.effectivefundraising.net/1/post/2013/08/how-we-select-our-charities.html
and currently we think Givewell is the strongest charity evaluator in the area of global poverty, and if they thought Project Healthy Children was a strong cause they would have recommended it. Where we currently do not feel Givewell is the strongest charity evaluator in animal rights since they have explicitly stated they don’t value animals the same way we do, although if they did do research in that area that could change.]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>1324</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1329</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Benjamin Todd</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>benjamin.john.todd@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/benjamin-todd</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-09-16 17:51:52</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Apologies for the confusion on that point.

Why? Because my passion in life is for singing bad karaoke. My friend Dodgy Dave’s passion is for dealing crack cocaine. Some of my friends have many passions. Most of my friends have none.

“Do what you’re good at” is better, but still stupid. It gets things the wrong way around. For almost all activities, being “good at” something is the result of [thousands of hours of practice and learning](http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/everything/ericsson2007a.pdf) (pdf). In choosing a career, you’re almost always making the decision about what to become good at, not the other way around.

How, then, should you find a job you’ll love?

<a href='http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/146/original/soon-to-be-graduates.jpg?1368979540'><img alt="Soon-to-be-graduates" class="image medium" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/eightythousand.org/posts/images/146/medium/soon-to-be-graduates.jpg?1368979540" /></a>

Here’s my slogan: ”Do something valuable.”

Let the problems in the world dictate what you do, rather than forcing a preconceived checklist labeled “success,” to be your motivation. Do something that genuinely helps others and makes the world a better place in a major way. That’s the way to have a happy, fulfilled life.

When I tell people this, half think it’s crazy and half think it’s trivial. I think it’s neither. So here’s a three-part explanation.

First, here’s the intuition. Think about yourself at 85, sitting on your rocking chair, looking back on your life. You, Version 1, think: “I made a ton of cash, own three beach houses and a yacht. But what was the point of it all?” Compare with You, Version 2: “I made a lot of money. I also dewormed the entire childhood population of Burundi. But what was the point of it all?” We find it pretty easy to imagine You, Version 1; but the thought of You, Version 2 being dissatisfied is jarring. If you want lasting job satisfaction, you should do something you find meaningful. And the best way to do something you find meaningful is to do something that actually is meaningful.

Second, here’s the science:

**Acting altruistically makes you healthier and happier.** [This study found that people](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/24592/) who volunteer for good causes report higher levels of happiness and health than those who don’t volunteer. The authors suggest that volunteering gives you a sense of perspective—so that when you judge how well your life is going, you’re aware of people who are less privileged than you as well as people who are better off than you.

**Giving money makes you happier.** [Another study](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5870/1687.full.pdf?sid=2b76fa84-7821-4bee-b2b4-309fa899866a) gave participants $20: half were told to spend the sum on themselves; the other half were told to spend it on others. It was the charitable half that reported greater happiness after spending their windfall, even though participants believed that spending on themselves would make them happier. Similarly, in a representative study of American citizens, those who donated a greater proportion of their income were happier, as were workers who donated a larger proportion of their bonuses.

And [it’s been found](http://www.orbee.org/images/5cc-resource-files/1319789168_Hackman%20%26%20Oldham%20%281976%29.pdf) (pdf) that **one of the most important factors in job satisfaction is how much your work affects the well-being of others.** Feeling that you’re making a difference makes it easier to get into the state of flow, or complete immersion in an activity. And, the greater significance you attribute to your work, [the higher your job performance](http://esoltanieh.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Edwin_Locke_Handbook_of_Principles_of_Organizational_Behavior_Indispensable_Knowledge_for_Evidence-Based_Management__2009.pdf#page=139) (pdf).

Finally, I can speak from personal experience. I used to work because I wanted to be The World’s Best Philosopher—something like Wittgenstein 2.0. Now I work because I want to help others. This has improved my life in many ways. I now have a deeper sense of meaning and completeness in my life. I know I’m living up to my own values, rather than following the crowd. And I feel a tremendous clarity and resolution of purpose. There’s no messing around trying to find the “true me”—it doesn’t exist. In contrast, the problems in the world are real, and concrete. So I never doubt my aims now: altruism is the one thing you can do that you know you won’t regret.

When it comes to self-interest, everyone is competing for the same things: money, fame, power, status. So if you want anything, you’ve got to fight everyone else for it. But when it comes to altruism, there’s no competition—everyone wants the same thing, namely to make people better off. So it’s much easier to be wildly successful as an altruist—you’ll find other people supporting you at every step.

So does that mean you should drop everything and work for Oxfam? As [I’ve previously argued](http://qz.com/57254/to-save-the-world-dont-get-a-job-at-a-charity-go-work-on-wall-street/): not necessarily! What it does mean is that you should [start finding out what’s valuable](http://www.givewell.org/), and get help working out the ways [in which your career can make](http://80000hours.org/career-resources) for a better world.

It’s a sad fact, but attractive people are more persuasive than the rest of us[^footnote1]. In elections, attractive candidates seem to receive far more votes[^footnote2]. Attractive people even get paid more for doing the same work[^footnote3]. This influence seems to be subconscious. We don’t think beauty affects these decisions, but it does.

One day, you magnificent beast, you interview for an important job at the World Bank. The other applicant just isn’t in your league, not that you’d notice that. You’re not shallow. Anyhow, you go on to get the job. You don’t know it, but it turns out that the other applicant was a bit more qualified than you, but your appearance swung it for you. Your looks, however, are irrelevant to your skill in the job (you’re allocating funds to development programs, not modelling on the catwalk).

Several years go by. You do a lot of good work, which helps millions of people. Everyone is pleased.

Should they be?

If you hadn’t interviewed, and gotten the job as a result of your stunning looks, then the other person would have got it instead. And they would have been slightly better at it than you. They would have done more research, allowing the World Bank’s money to be spent more effectively. In fact, if the funds you allocate affect millions of people, and you do it just a little worse, then your true impact might easily have been to harm thousands of people. Oops.

So, attractive people, be careful. If you’re going to risk getting a job, try to get one where your natural advantages make you better at it. Everyone else, be suspicious. Attractive people can be dangerous.

The job requires lots of negotiating with foreign Government officials and giving speeches, both of which would benefit from having an attractive person at the helm.

It's hard to say whether the interviewer could tell, in marginal cases, which candidate is best qualified.  A lot doesn't go on a resume.

Is it possible that, as a result of biases through the lives of attractive people, they have received more benefits than unattractive people?  If so, isn't attractiveness then a signal of all the favor the candidate has received throughout his/her life?  Just a thought.  Many recruiters are not better than a coin toss.

Anyone read anything that speaks to this?

Also, what about men/women?  I'm not so informed, but I believe things like pay gaps are about as serious or more so.  This one's also a lot easier for members to pin down, when considering our own careers (although a survey of friends as to my own attractiveness might yield interesting results, too, I suppose).]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Dead children currency</title><link>http://80000hours.org/blog/51-dead-children-currency--51</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[I think dead children should be used as a unit of currency. I know this sounds controversial, but hear me out.

According to Population Services International, a respected charity research group, it costs [between $650 and $1000](http://www.givewell.org/international/charities/PSI) to save one child's life through charity. You've probably heard lower numbers like twenty cents somewhere. The lower numbers are wrong. Yes, maybe an anti-measles vaccine for a kid in Africa only costs twenty cents, and measles can be fatal. But there's a lot of overhead, and you have to immunize a lot of people before you get the one kid otherwise destined to die of measles. I find the $650-$1000 figure much more believable. Let's round it off to $800.

So one dead child = eight hundred dollars. If you spend eight hundred dollars on a laptop, that's one African kid who died because you didn't give it to charity. Distasteful but true. Now that we know that, we can get down to the details of designing the currency itself. It should be a big gold coin, with a picture of a smiling Burmese child on the front, and a tombstone on the back. The abbreviation can be DC.

Of course, most things won't cost a whole dead child, so we'll need smaller denominations. There are four dead puppies to the dead child, since [dogs cost a bit above $200 to keep alive in an animal shelter](http://www.helpsaveastray.com/?f). There are two [burnt rainforests](http://www.staro.org/index.php?id=faq039s) per puppy, and five infected wounds(1) per burnt rainforest. I'm sure we can find talented artists to design the coins for all of these.

Yes, you grudgingly admit, such a system is technically feasible, but why in blue blazes would we want to replace our reassuring green dollar bills graced with dignified ex-presidents with that?

I leave that question to an article I read on the BBC site today: [woman spends £250,000 on a luxury doghouse for her Great Danes complete with spa and plasma TV](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/7750192.stm).

This does sound sort of ridiculous, but clearly it is not ridiculous enough. After all, at least one person thought it would be a good idea. Clearly, saying "doghouse that costs 250,000 pounds" does not carry the appropriate punch of "do not buy this."

And that's why I recommend switching to a dead-child-based currency. "Doghouse that costs 250,000 pounds" might not carry the proper punch. "Doghouse that costs 500 dead children" does. Using dead children as a unit of currency carries a built-in awareness of [opportunity](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/11/positive-vs-opt.html) [costs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_costs). Yes, you can buy that doghouse, if you really think it's more important than spending that same money to save five hundred Haitian kids' lives. Go on! Dogs watching plasma TV! That sounds adorable!

After reading an article about [Mormon tithing practices](http://www.exmormon.org/mormon/mormon403.htm), I am hopeful that the switch from dollars to DCs will destroy organized religion as well. It sounds plausible for a church to say it needs two million dollars to move to a larger building. It even sounds plausible when a pastor gets up there in front of his congregation and says that God really wants every family to just give whatever little bit they're able, so that they can all buy a better house of worship and praise God in a more fitting sanctuary. My old synagogue did this for years, and no one found anything wrong with it; my parents even donated quite a big chunk of money. If my rabbi'd had to say "We need twenty-five hundred dead children to move to a sweeter pad", the gig would have been up.

Not like I am any saint myself. The past two years, I've spent about two dead puppies on books from Amazon.com alone. I am probably going to spend very close to a whole dead child to fly home for my two week winter break, and I spent ten dead children on my trip around the world this summer. I spent four infected wounds on fantasy map-making software. But at least in the back of my mind I realize I'm doing it. Can the people who spend a dead kid plus a dead puppy on [the world's most expensive sundae](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/02/14/worlds-most-expensiv.html) say the same? What about [the Japanese guy spending 1050 dead kids on a mobile phone strap](http://www.luxist.com/2007/01/03/diamond-studded-mobile-phone-strap/)?

One of America's top pro-life groups, Focus on the Family, spends [two hundred thousand dead children a year](http://blog.christianitytoday.com/ctliveblog/archives/2008/11/focus_on_the_fa.html) pushing its message of conservatism and opposition to abortion. Take a second to fully appreciate the irony there.

I'm not saying these people don't have a right to spend their presumably hard-earned money on whatever they want. Of course they have that right. I am just saying that if we took the simple common sense step of changing our monetary denomination from dollars to dead children, maybe they'd want something different.

C'mon, I bet you an infected wound it'd work great.

1) If abortion is the destruction/murder of children, which many pro-life campaigners think it is, then the sums SPUC and other groups spend lobbying against the practice may well turn out to be very cost effective (assuming it makes at least some impact), even on your own value system which accepts, as most do, that children being dead is a bad thing. FOTF spend a lot of money elsewhere - James Dobson's salary is absurd and they pump out of lot of homophobic bigotry, but I think good consequentialists could well sympathise with pro-life campaign groups.

2) The cost of preventing child death is not constant, and the relative costs of dead children, dead puppies, burnt rainforests and infected wounds are not fixed either. I know you're not really advocating dead children as a currency, but it wouldn't be workable as you've outlined it.  I'd just stick with one of them as a measure of wasted money. (I remember an MP in the UK describing the cost of the government rescue of Northern Rock as '900 Millenium Domes' - this certainly made the point well).]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>0</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>391</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Jacob Trefethen</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>jt497@cam.ac.uk</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/jacob-trefethen</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2012-06-29 06:34:15</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ah, but as the cost of preventing child death is driven up by effective donation (diminishing marginal returns and all that) the bundle of goods one could buy for 1 deadchild will become larger over time (or, equivalently, the same bundle of goods will cost fewer deadchilds).

##Summary

For most people, having a career which is a good “fit” for their personality is extremely high priority. Unsurprisingly, the notion of “person-environment fit” is fundamental to most careers advice. The general idea is that a) people have different personalities and interests, b) different types of people are suited to different working environments and c) finding the right working environment for your personality and interests is crucial to finding a job you’ll enjoy and be successful in.

However, despite several decades of research, psychologists have failed to demonstrate that personality/interests fit with the workplace has any substantial effect on job satisfaction or job performance. This suggests the normal approach of first working out your interests and personality and then finding a job to match them might be wrong - it doesn’t seem to help you find a job you enjoy or are good at!

This is surprising: it seems intuitively obvious that your personality fit with your job is important. It might be that the effect is too complex to be picked up in the existing studies, and that improved survey design would uncover a stronger connection. **But we should also consider whether being a good personality fit with your work is less important than we first think.** We’ve found good evidence that other factors: doing engaging work, as we define [here](http://80000hours.org/blog/134-our-research-on-how-to-find-a-job-you-love), and good social support at work, are important for finding a satisfying job. We’ve also had independent reason to think that following your interests [isn’t a good way to find a good job.](http://80000hours.org/blog/63-don-t-do-what-you-re-passionate-about-part-2)


**Therefore we recommend:**
* **Don’t focus so much on ‘following your interests’ and finding a job that fits your personality and interests type**
* **Instead, focus more on finding good social support (opportunities to receive help in the workplace), [engaging work](http://80000hours.org/blog/68-how-to-find-a-job-you-ll-love) (work with good feedback, autonomy, well defined tasks and so on), developing mastery of that work, and [making a positive impact](http://80000hours.org/blog/75-should-we-sacrifice-doing-what-we-love-to-make-a-difference-part-1).**

##Holland Types

To evaluate whether person-environment fit matters in job satisfaction, we need some way to measure it. “Holland types”, a theory developed by psychologist John Holland, are currently the best developed scheme, and indeed are one of the most empirically tested areas of work psychology.

According to Holland’s theory, most people can be categorised by six types for the purpose of job matching:

**Realistic:** (“Doers”) Enjoys manipulation of objects, working with tools, machines, or animals. Sees oneself as practical and mechanical. 

**Investigative:** (“Thinkers”) Enjoys systematic and creative investigation of natural and cultural phenomena, analysing and solving problems. Sees oneself as precise, scientific and intellectual.

**Artistic:** (“Creators”) Enjoys working in unstructured situations using imagination and creativity. Sees oneself as expressive, original and independent.

**Social:** (“Helpers”) Enjoys helping, informing, and training others. Sees oneself as helpful, friendly and trustworthy.

**Enterprising:** (“Persuaders”) Enjoys leading and persuading others. Sees oneself as energetic, ambitious and sociable.

**Conventional:** (“Organizers”) Enjoys working with data, carrying out tasks in detail and following others’ instructions. Sees oneself as orderly and good at following a set plan.

Each type appears to be a combination of personality and interests, though this is controversial in the literature. [^5]

##Holland’s Theory of Career Choice

Using Holland codes to determine person-environment fit in a career is supported by the [Handbook for Career Advising](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Handbook-Career-Advising-Josseybass/dp/0470373687), where it’s claimed that doing so “provides a useful structure that organizes a tremendous amount of information that can be readily applied”, providing a “structure for students to understand themselves.” The Occupational Information Network ([ONET](http://www.onetonline.org/)) has also put a huge amount of effort into [using Holland types](http://www.onetonline.org/find/descriptor/browse/Interests/).

How are Holland types used in career choice? Most people are all six types in varying degrees, and your three most dominant types make up your “Holland Code.” There are well developed tests you can take to identify your Holland Code, like the [Self-Directed Search](http://www.self-directed-search.com/). There are various free tests too, although they’re likely to be less accurate. The idea is that once you have your “code”, you can search for jobs which best match that code.

The key conclusion drawn from all this is that people are more likely to be satisfied and successful in environments where the environment type matches their personality type.

##How useful is this approach?

What evidence is there that this approach is actually predictive of job success and satisfaction?

The literature on this is controversial. One meta-survey argues that the theory is invalid.[^1] First, it claims there are different ways to measure “degree of fit” between person and work environment, and these different ways turn out to give significantly different answers. This is a serious problem for the theory as it means your “fit” with a job based on personality type is ambiguous. Moreover, the survey finds no correlation between degree of fit and job satisfaction.

Two large meta-studies (involving ~9,000 people) looking at degree of fit and job satisfaction found slight correlation between the two, but still surprisingly weak: one found a correlation of 0.1 and another 0.2.[^2] This hardly indicates the theory is highly useful for job selection, since it means it only accounts for 1-4% of the variation in levels of job satisfaction.

Similarly, a large meta-study on job selection showed that interests, as measured with Holland types, are only very weakly predictive of job performance, with a correlation of 0.1.[^6]

This said, demonstrating this kind of validity is complex. There are many reasons why the correlations might be weak even if the theory were in fact predictive. For instance, there might be a third, moderator variable that affects the strength of the relationship between degree of fit and satisfaction that we’re missing[^3], or the measures being used might simply be unreliable. It seems we have good prior reason to think that people do care about “fitting in” at work, and that this is justified, so we’d need strong evidence to think fitting in really doesn’t matter.

Something else worth considering is that, if Holland’s theory is correct, we’d expect people to have already self-selected into jobs based on their types (at least to some extent.) This would mean that merely performing correlation studies will understate how predictive of satisfaction the personality types are.[^4] To avoid this, ideally we’d want to perform full longitudinal studies. We might also want to investigate the extent to which peoples’ existing job choices fit with what the theory would prescribe based on personality type. 

There’s also independent evidence that people seem to move towards jobs with a higher degree of fit when given a choice. Assuming that people are correctly optimising for job satisfaction, this suggests that “degree of fit” as defined by Holland types is relevant.

Another study argues that degree of fit is a sufficient but not necessary condition for job satisfaction. If your Holland type fits with your work environment, you’re likely to be satisfied, but it’s also possible to be satisfied even if you don’t “fit” in this sense.[^7]

Finally, psychologists are investigating other measures of person-environment fit, which may be more promising.

It seems surprising that none of this debate is acknowledged by the Handbook of Careers Advice, and that the majority of careers advisers aren’t aware that the actual case for using Holland types is so weak. In fact, the literature on job satisfaction suggests that [much stronger predictors of job satisfaction are characteristics of the job itself](http://80000hours.org/blog/68-how-to-find-a-job-you-ll-love], but careers advice seems to focus less on this. This might be partly because Holland types depend on the individual so allow advisers to provide more personalised advice, whereas job characteristics depend on the nature of the job itself.

##What can we conclude from all of this?

The evidence is pretty unclear on how useful matching based on Holland codes is for predicting job satisfaction. This means that, for now at least, it’s probably better to focus on other things besides “person-environment fit”, such as job characteristics and social support, where the evidence is stronger. However, it’s worth noting that:

1. Improved survey design might uncover a stronger relationship between Holland matching and job satisfaction
2. The evidence that Holland matching is *sufficient* for job satisfaction is stronger, suggesting you could view Holland matching as one path (among several) to finding a satisfying job.
3. Even if Holland matching isn’t predictive of job satisfaction, this doesn’t mean that person-environment fit isn’t important, as this is only one way to measure it. Although, given the effort put into developing Holland types, it’s not a promising sign for the importance of person-environment fit.

[^4]: Further explanation of this point: Holland’s theory says that 1. People will look for work environments that fit their personality type and 2. People are more satisfied in careers where there is a high degree of fit. If 1. is true, assuming people have at least some implicit knowledge of their own skills and preferences, people will be fairly well matched to careers to start with. This means that if 2. is true, then differences in satisfaction in careers must be mostly explained by factors other than personality - external factors or more objective job characteristics, for example. This would result in a weak correlation between degree of fit and and job satisfaction, even if the former is predictive of the latter.

## Summary

**Purpose of the call:** We organized this call to learn more about the value of getting a PhD in economics to help advise people considering that path, which we think is a potentially promising route in academia.

**Why this person:** We sought Robin’s thoughts because he is a like-minded economics professor with whom we already had a relationship.

We discussed what career options are available to people who get PhDs in economics, who is a good fit for a PhD in economics, and how to maximize one’s impact in economics. We did not discuss highly data-oriented questions, such as PhD acceptance rates, tenure rates, and portions of economics PhDs working in different areas.

An economics PhD is

1. generally necessary for becoming an economics professor 		

2. can be a promising route (among some other potentially promising routes) to finding work in think tanks, government agencies, international organizations such as the World Bank,	

3. can be helpful for getting a job in consulting. 	

Good indicators of fit for an economics PhD include aptitude for math, interest in economics, being open-minded about research topics, being able to work on challenging tasks with little direction from others, and being willing to put in a lot of hours. A firm grasp of basic economics concepts and theory, developed through years of practice, is very valuable for understanding how the social world works, which is helpful for evaluating causes and interventions.

# **Questions about career progression for economics PhDs**

## Apart from becoming economics professors, what do economics PhDs do?

An economics PhD can also be helpful for finding work in think tanks, government agencies, international NGOs (such as the World Bank), and consulting. In general, the primary reason to get a PhD in economics is to become an economics professor. However, if someone had a strong desire to work at, say, the World Bank, it could make sense to get a PhD in economics for that reason.

## How does getting an economics PhD compare with other options for getting these types of jobs?

Research jobs at think tanks generally require PhDs (such as political science, public policy, or sometimes sociology) or law degrees. Some people with appropriate technical degrees can find work at subject-relevant think tanks, though there is still a need to show the ability to write policy papers. For example, someone with a PhD in computer science might find work at a think tank working on technology/internet issues. In very rare cases, people can get research jobs at think tanks without professional degrees by proving their ability to write on relevant topics. Matt Yglesias getting a job at the Center for American Progress is one example.

To maximize influence on policy, there is a strong presumption in favor of working in fields and research areas within fields that are most prestigious. For people who are a good fit for economics, this often favors economics over other PhDs or law degrees. However, law can be a better fit in cases where legal issues are very important. Political science stands out if one wants to influence policy by helping people win elections.

## How competitive are the non-university jobs?

Professor jobs are generally more prestigious and harder to get than jobs at think tanks, which are generally more prestigious and harder to get than jobs at government agencies. It is generally easier to move from the more prestigious jobs to the less prestigious jobs.

## How do non-university jobs compare in terms of impact?

The impact you can have in university jobs tends to be more indirect and flexible, whereas impact in think tanks or government tends to be more direct and focused on specific issues. If you know which issues you want to work on and believe those issues stand out in terms of opportunities for impact, this can favor the non-university jobs.

# **Who is a good fit for an economics PhD?**

Good indicators of fit include aptitude for math, interest in economics, being open-minded about research topics, being able to work on challenging tasks with little direction from others, and being willing to put in a lot of hours. Strong past academic performance is not a very strong indicator of good fit because it may not translate in ability independently choose good research questions and make progress on them.

# **How to maximize impact within economics**

## Selecting a PhD program

Prospective PhD students often underemphasize general prestige of a program relative to fit with their interests. PhD students often change their interests in the course of their degree, and this strongly counts in favor of choosing a program that is strong overall, not just strong in the student’s area of interest.

## How economists influence policy

Economists rarely influence policy as advisors for people who haven’t made up their minds and want advice. Instead, people who favor a certain position generally seek policy advisors who they will expect will provide arguments favoring their position. So economists, and other policy advisors, often have influence mainly by providing ammunition for advocates of the views they support. There is more room for influence if you provide policy recommendations that are orthogonal to popular disputes.

## What kinds of economic insights are most valuable for doing good?

There is a tendency for people interested in doing good to overemphasize questions about values relative to causal questions about how the social world works. Part of the problem is that people assume that they understand how the social world works, but they do not. A firm grasp of basic economics concepts and theory, developed through years of practice, is very valuable for understanding how the social world works. However, there are strongly diminishing returns to learning much more advanced economics.

## How well do research incentives in economics line up with research that would do the most good?

A great deal of economics is comparing the welfare consequences of different policies, and this research is highly aligned with questions that effective altruists are concerned about. An important difference is that economics tends not to emphasize the methods and political feasibility of enacting different policies as much as effective altruists would like.

For effective altruism, a qualitative, broad understanding of how the world works is very valuable, and there are generally diminishing returns to understanding a topic in greater and greater depth. This conflicts with research incentives in economics, which favor making impressive, in-depth progress on hard questions that many other people work on.

People who feel that economics research incentives do not align with trying to do research that is optimized for positive impact may want to spend 7 to 11 years doing what it takes to get tenure, and then work on whatever it is they want to work on. One can also make substantial contributions outside of one’s academic work.

Research in academia tends to clump onto fashionable topics in a given area, and the incentives favor publishing in these areas. Fashionable areas tend to be more important than average, but marginal contributions yield less progress in areas where a lot of work has already been done. Work on important topics in between clumps can yield great progress for those who can afford to ignore fashion.

Prestige, money, something you’re [passionate about](http://80000hours.org/blog/62-don-t-do-what-you-re-passionate-about-part-1), a corner office? [Books]( http://www.amazon.co.uk/Career-Ahead-Complete-Handbook/dp/0956111807) on careers guidance often start by asking you to consider your values and desired lifestyle, and then to find a job that matches them. But why expect this approach to work? Research has shown that the only thing that's consistently present in satisfying jobs is that the work itself is engaging (1)(2), suggesting that finding engaging work should be the starting point for a satisfying career.

What makes for mental challenging work is broken down into five qualities (4):

* * *

1.	**Independence** –how much are you able to individually decide how to go about the work?

2.	**Sense of Completion**– how much does the job involve completing a whole piece of work, so that your contribution to the end product is easily visible, rather than a small part of a much larger product?

3.	**Variety** – how much does the job require you to perform a range of different activities, using different skills and talents?

4.	**Feedback from the job** – how much does the work itself provide clues about how well you are doing?

5.	**Contribution** – how much does your work affect the wellbeing of other people?

* * * 

A large meta-analysis of survey results (2) showed that each correlates with job satisfaction (mean r=0.41), as well as with motivation, productivity and commitment to your employer. Job complexity and the degree of information processing required are similarly strong predictors, but the evidence is weaker (2).

There's also some indirect support for this conclusion. 

First, employee surveys about job satisfaction (3) have shown that “interesting work” turns out to be what’s most important to people, as opposed to pay or status.

Second, the five characteristics, in particular 4. and 2. are similar to the conditions needed to enter a state of [flow]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29) (5)(6) – the pleasurable state of being so immersed in an activity that you’re completely free of distractions and lose track of time. [Csikszentmihalyi](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Flow-Psychology-Happiness-Classic-Achieve/dp/0712657592) has argued that being able to enter states of flow is key to having genuinely satisfying experiences, so we’d expect this link.

* * *

Third, the characteristics are closely related to the characteristics that lead to high intrinsic motivation, which we'd expect to be a crucial part of a satisfying job. Our best current theory of motivation, the Self-Determination Theory, (8) holds that what we require to motivated is:
* Autonomy: exactly as above
* Competence: the feeling you're good at what you do
* Relatedness: the feeling of connection to other people
Competence can arise when you have a sense of completion and feedback from the job i.e. engaging work. Relatedness suggests that some social factors might also be important for job satisfaction. We'll write about these in the future.

The book *Drive* by Pink popularises this theory. Pink drops relatedness, but instead includes *purpose* in your work. This is exactly the same as contribution above.

Finally, the fifth characteristic is the extent to which you make a difference. In the 80,000 Hours community, we’ve long suspected that leading your career for others leads to happiness. We write about this [here](/http://80000hours.org/blog/75-should-we-sacrifice-doing-what-we-love-to-make-a-difference-part-1)

Engaging work is important for everyone’s job satisfaction, but it’s much more important for some people rather than others. If you want your jobs to contribute to personal growth and derive satisfaction from performing challenging tasks (characteristics measured with the Growth Need Strength (GNS) score), then finding challenging work should by far be your main concern (7). If you’re wondering, you can measure your score [here]( http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0070876940/student_view0/chapter5/activity_5_4.html).

###Am I different?###

This post has been all about averages, and you might object that as an individual, your individual preferences will tend to overwhelm information about what satisfies the average person.  "Sure," you might say, "challenging work is important, but so is income, status, and so on."

This might be true. I’m certainly not suggesting that you ignore all the other information you have about what work you’d enjoy. I am suggesting, however, that we *start* our assessment of which jobs we’ll enjoy with the attributes that normally work. Extra information (for instance based on what's worked well for you in the past) should be used to *adjust* our expectations about what will make us satisfied away from what works for the average person. Doing this reduces the chance that we overweight the significance of specific, individual information about what we enjoy (i.e. make the common [base rate fallacy]( http://michaelgr.com/2007/11/24/cognitive-bias-base-rate-fallacy/)). Moreover, while working out what work we’ll enjoy, we should take account of the many biases that hamper our ability to predict what makes us happy. The presence of these biases means that when seeking a job we’ll love, we should place significantly more weight on what normally leads to job satisfaction than we might have first thought, and compared to what happens in conventional careers guidance.

Without knowledge of your GNS score, the 5 characteristics are approximately equally good predictors of job satisfaction (mean r=0.4). Task identity is a little bit weaker than the others.

I only came across the result that if you have a high GNS, then you should weight mental challenge overall more highly. I guess the study would have been done with a combined ‘mental challenge’ score consisting of all 5 characteristics. I didn’t come across studies showing the impact of knowledge about GNS on the predictive power of the individual characteristics. It could easily be out there though.

Common advice in choosing a career is “do what you’re passionate about.” An article on [lifehack]( http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/how-to-find-your-passion.html) begins: “If you could do one thing to transform your life, I would highly recommend it be to find something you’re passionate about, and do it for a living.” The first paragraph of the major careers advice book *Career Ahead* ends “You owe it to yourself to do work that you love. This book will show you how.” But what happens if your passion is for beautifully executed contract killings?

“Do what you’re passionate about” and “do what you love” are not a good rules to follow in career choice. You can be passionate about something – being a hitman – that there are good reasons not to do.  In the case of being a hitman, it’s because the career causes harm. Similar cases could arise if the career radically under-uses your potential, rather than being actually harmful. And what about if you’re passionate about a career, but also *terrible* at what it involves? Suppose you adore playing basketball, but you’ll never be selected by a team because you’re also extremely short.

On the other side, there can be careers that are [well worth pursuing] even if you’re not passionate about them. Consider a former world-expert astrophysicist who has become a librarian, because she found the work too stressful, and so, lost her passion for studying astrophysics. One day, NASA arrives to recruit her. A large asteroid has been detected that will probably hit the Earth. Since this scientist’s speciality was asteroid deflection, NASA believes her efforts will increase their chance of saving the world. Should the scientist turn down the job because she’s no longer passionate about astrophysics? This is the oft used movie plot of the hero coming out of retirement and rediscovering their calling, as explored in [Rambo III]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambo_III) and [The Dark Knight Rises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Rises).

Similar examples can also be made for “do what you’re good at”. Not only might you be passionate about your work as a hitman, but you could be the best hitman in the world. Does it follow that you should make it your career? Being good at a career doesn’t mean you should do it. Suppose you want to pursue [professional philanthropy](http://80000hours.org/career-research#professional-philanthropy). You happen to be extremely good at low-paid factory meatpacking and below average at medicine. Being a doctor isn’t what you’re good at, but should you skip medicine in favour of meatpacking? It can be better to take careers you’re not good at.

At this point, you might protest: sure “do what you’re passionate about” need not apply in every case, but it’s still a good rule of thumb: it’s a good heuristic. But even this is not the case…

What we found out:

* **Meta-research seems really important.** There could be some very high leverage opportunities in looking at the bigger picture and trying to figure out which questions are the most important, as there's still a lot of uncertainty here.
* **Just by caring about the impact of your research, you're already making a difference.** Many people seem not to care about doing important research, or at least don't think about it.
* **If you want to advocate high impact research, it's probably best to target young researchers.** It's generally very hard to get established academics to change their views, but people entering the academic field might be easier to influence.
* **You can also make a big difference by trying to pull funding into more important areas.** It may be easier to do this as an academic than by trying to get onto a funding body, as it's hard to fully influence what funding gets spent on from the top level down.
* **There's still a lot of uncertainty about what the most important questions are, so be careful.** Working to reduce these uncertainties by focusing on meta-level questions, or questions that are fairly robust in the face of uncertainty, could be good ways to deal with this.

**Tell us a bit about how you ended up where you are now**

For as long as I can remember, I’ve been interested in the potential for changing the human condition in some fundamental way, and how this could have a huge impact. This was back in the days before the internet was popular though, so I had no idea of anyone else who was interested in this. In the meantime I just tried to learn enough to put myself in a better position to work on these things later on. Later when I came to London as an exchange student I discovered there were other folk out there discussing similar things.

I had a bit of an intellectual awakening aged 15 or 16; before that I hated school. The realisation that there was a world of learning, ideas, culture, art and philosophy much more interesting than what we were being taught made me hate school even more! I felt like I needed to make up for lost time, so I started to guide my own studies: picking up lots of different subjects that seemed relevant. Once at university I tried to study many things in parallel. But there was a cap on how many subjects you could enrol in. At one point I actually got expelled from the psychology faculty for studying too much! 

**How did you get to setting up the Future of Humanity Institute in Oxford?**

After my PhD I went to Yale, and then came to Oxford as a British Academy postdoctoral fellow in philosophy, where I met more people interested in the same things as me. I tried to find topics in philosophy that would be acceptable to academic philosophers while still being relevant to the world, such as anthropic reasoning and applied ethics. The circumstances that led to me creating the FHI were very fortuitous: the Oxford Martin School was just in the process of being founded which made it possible. There was a huge amount of luck here: if the money for the Martin School had been given to Cambridge instead, for example, it might not have happened.

**What do you think are some of the best ways to find high impact research areas?**

There could be very high leverage opportunities looking at the bigger picture and trying to figure out what is important and what should be researched, because there are still very large uncertainties involved here. You could come at this from a variety of different disciplines: philosophy, computer science, maths, economics, neuroscience etc. 

Something else to bear in mind in terms of your impact is that in some fields the problems are pretty much predetermined, so your efforts go to speeding up progress on these problems; in others there’s more room for manoeuvre and you can actually change which problems are dealt with. The humanities, philosophy, and interdisciplinary fields seem to fall into this second category, whereas in science it’s often clearer where the big problems are. 

**Why do you think certain really important questions get neglected?**

This is a difficult question. One way to answer it would be to turn the question around: why do the things that *do* get studied, get studied? Often it’s because they’ve been studied before and a discipline has been established, which can lead to a great deal of inertia. The concept behind some of the questions that are important now are fairly new, which explains why they haven’t been studied in the past. The opportunity to develop artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and cognitive enhancement haven’t been around for that long. Another factor is that a lot of these questions are very interdisciplinary and there’s no standard protocol for investigating them. 

An even more frugal explanation for why people don’t focus on the most important questions is just that they don’t care that much. There are plenty of people who might care if they thought about it more, but they just don’t reflect on the importance of their research. This is where you can make a big difference just by encouraging people to think about the world in terms of impact.

**How important is your choice of thesis topic?**

There’s a risk of getting pigeon-holed by your PhD, and it’s easier to write one more article when you’ve already done a lot of research on a topic, so your choice of thesis area is important in this respect. It’s also four years of your peak intellectual period so you don’t want to squander this time unnecessarily. On the other hand, few people will ever actually read your PhD thesis.

It can be quite common, at least in philosophy, to enrol in a PhD program before you have a good topic and then spend the first year choosing your thesis idea. But disciplines can vary a lot in this respect: in the life sciences you probably have to chose before you start.

It is possible to shift your focus after your PhD. If you find what you are studying isn’t that useful you should seize that opportunity. Unfortunately it is more difficult to change departmental field.

**What about specialising vs. generalising: which do you think is better? Is it best to try and be a [T-shaped generalist](http://www.businessmodelalchemist.com/2006/08/specialized-generalist-or-t-shaped.html)?**

I’ve never made that sharp a distinction between different academic areas: wherever there’s stuff I find interesting I just learn that. But for the most part I don’t think academia rewards this attitude. That said, if you are lucky enough to find the right entry point, there can be good opportunities in multidisciplinary fields.

I think T-shaped generalising might help you in the long run: if you can pull it off you’ll probably be more productive and creative. But in the short term, it can slow down your career. Your chances of getting a postdoc and then tenure might be higher just by focussing exclusively on something that’s fashionable in your field.

**It seems like in most fields, [the top few researchers often seem to get almost all the attention](http://80000hours.org/blog/65-should-you-go-into-research-part-1). Do you have any tips for increasing your chances of becoming one of these top researchers?** 

In some fields, having a big impact is a matter of doing something unique. In philosophy, doing something slightly crazy is a way to get minor fame. For instance, you could choose an outlandish position and defend it better than people believe is possible. This is not not an activity I would recommend. But to become one of the top people you have to go beyond competent, solid work, and take some risks or go out on a limb somewhat, for example by showing that some common conception is false. I would imagine it’s similar in other humanities and social sciences at least.

If you can get into an elite university I think that can make a big difference. This might seem obvious to people in the UK and USA, but it’s less obvious elsewhere. In Sweden, for example, there isn’t much difference between the various universities, so it’s less clear to people that some universities can be way better than others. Having a “brand name” university is useful not just for intellectual development but also in terms of opportunity: for grants, media impact, collaborations and so on. At a less recognised university these things are possible but it’s more of an uphill struggle. It’s unfair, but nonetheless true.

That said, maybe sometimes there is a case for ending up in a middle rank university and being a “big fish in a small pond.” There might be more flexibility to do exactly what you want, for example.

**What about influencing other academics to think more about impact - how easy do you think this is to do?**

It’s hard to get established academics to change their views, unless they spontaneously become interested in a topic, or bear a latent interest for a topic they were unable to pursue in the past. If you can show them a way to get funding, they may well look at it again.

Otherwise, there’s probably more leverage in influencing people who are just entering the academic world. At the FHI we’ve done this [thesis competition](http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/news/2012/?a=26490) to get people to write a thesis outline on some important topic, with a prize for the best one. They don’t actually have to write their thesis on it, but the idea is to get people spending time thinking about important areas, which will hopefully at least increase the chance of these areas getting researched. 

**How easy is it to influence what research is conducted by getting into a position of power in an organisation that provides funding and grants?**

A lot of the grants in academia actually end up being dispersed by the academics who conduct the evaluations. Even when someone higher up in a funding body is trying to set priorities, it’s hard for them to change how the money is used on the ground. At each stage in the chain of management, the goals are shifted slightly, until the intention of the top-level managers is largely forgotten.

Probably in the natural sciences it is easier to exercise control than in the humanities. Presumably you could get a lab to work on one vaccine rather than another. If you’re funding a big group working on some structured project it’s easier to impose control, but in fields like philosophy where you’re funding individuals it’s difficult to influence what they end up thinking about.

**Is there more opportunity to [pull funding sideways](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/05/policy_tugowar.html) from within academia, then?**

In philosophy it’s hard to pull funding because there’s just not much money. But there are other opportunities for academics to pull money into more important fields, and this is arguably better than getting onto the board of a funding body.   

Other things equal, it’s much nicer to take money from some big organisation which has a bad focus. Then you are simply rescuing the funds from being wasted. But in fact I think it should be fairly easy to make much better use of funding than the average academic - even without any particular competence, just caring about getting funding into important areas puts you above the many others who don’t. So there’s no need to go out of your way to try to get your funding at the expense of the least effective projects.

**Finally, if you could give just one piece of advice to a student wanting to make a difference through research, what would it be?**

There’s a lot of uncertainty in our understanding of the world and it’s really difficult to know what is valuable. This is why working on meta-level questions and trying to figure out what’s important might be a good option. You have to know which direction to start walking before you set out on your journey. Another good tactic would be to focus on projects that are robust in the face of great uncertainty. Making people generally more benevolent and compassionate might be an example of this: it’s hard to see how that would turn out badly. The bottom line is that it’s not all that obvious yet what research is most important, so think twice.

Like both Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld, Jon Behar left a lucrative job at a hedge fund to create a startup called ["A Path That’s Clear"](http://www.apaththatsclear.com/).  Here, he runs “Giving Games” which engage people around the world in discussions about effective giving.

Rob Wiblin and I sat down to interview Jon Behar and learn more about his career choices and what it’s like to leave your job to pursue dreams of running effective altruist projects. Here’s what we learned:

* It can be worthwhile to take some time off to think about things if you no longer are enjoying your job.

* Working on something that you think is important can make you more motivated in the job and generally more satisfied.

* When starting an effective altruist project, it could be important to consider how you could partner with an existing organization rather than proliferate the large amount of EA orgs that exist.

* The best way to get into a career in any field is to find people who are already in that field and ask them for advice, even if you don’t know them. You’ll be surprised by the number of people who agree to speak with you.

**How did you get involved with "A Path That's Clear"?  What lead you to decide to put a lot of time into it?**

I got interested in effective giving through [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org/).  I used to work at a hedge fund with GiveWell’s co-founders and that’s how I learned about the organization and got interested in effective giving.

At the end of 2010, I left the hedge fund to take time off, try something new, and find a new direction in life, because I had been getting burned out and running out of passion for the work in finance.  I moved to San Francisco and had a lot of free time to think about things.

One of the questions I kept thinking about was why people don’t give to more effective charities.  People respond to GiveWell by saying "Oh, that sounds great, but I give to Charity ABC for XYZ reason" and presumably impact isn’t one of the criteria that matter to them.  GiveWell can close an information gap, but we need to know how to address people’s beliefs that lead them to actually use that information to give more effectively.

I saw Giving Games as a way to learn more about why people don’t yet give effectively and how to get them to do so.  Once I realized how flexible and powerful the model was, I saw it as something I wanted to pursue and invest my time and effort.  This was made easier by the fact that I wasn’t working at the time and was basically just sitting around between jobs.

**Do you intend to make a living out of this?**

Yes, I’d like to.  I think that’s feasible by running a Giving Games program for a larger organization.  There’s also speaking opportunities which I haven’t done yet, but are starting to line up now -- go to a school, run a Giving Game, do a Q&A, and engage with the students that way.


I’d like to make a package where anyone could run their own Giving Game, but I want to make it freely available so as to not create barriers for encouraging effective giving.  However, I’d be open to charging a fee for my appearances and make a living that way.

**Did you compare this opportunity with other opportunities that might be high impact, or did you just pick this option and run with it?**


I did some thinking about other options.  I had considered going back into the finance world and "earn to give", but the more I thought about the future of A Path That’s Clear, the more confident I became that this was really the highest leverage thing I could do and something I thought I would enjoy more.

**Has that turned out to be the case?  Has your passion made this job a lot more easier and successful?**


I think so.  It feels good to be working on something that I feel is important and I think it’s really helped me connect with a lot of other people who are passionate about good giving.  I think I am a lot happier and more productive than I would be in a more traditional job.

**Have you thought about starting a company and hiring employees to run these Giving Games?**

Where I’ve basically landed I was going to, if possible, avoid building an organization from the ground up.  I think a better model is to find existing organizations who like the idea and have the desire and resources to scale it and basically get one or several of them to absorb the idea so I don’t have to go through the trouble of building the organization and team from scratch which could be incredibly time consuming.  Instead, we hope to develop our relationship further with [The Life You Can Save](http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/) and partner with them to run the programs using their resources and brand.

**You wouldn’t mind having your idea taken over, so to speak?**

Not at all.  I think there already is an issue of a proliferation of brands in non-profits in general and in EA space, so I don’t want to clutter it any further.  Giving Games are basically just an idea that is hopefully clever and anyone can do it and run with it once they hear the idea.  There’s no sense of intellectual property and I want people to take the idea and implement it and experiment with it.  I don’t by any means think I’ve found the perfect model -- it still needs to be refined.  The more people try new things and share information, the faster we’ll all be implementing better processes.

**Can other people get involved in "A Path That's Clear"?  If so, how?**

They can email [info@apaththatsclear.com](mailto:info@apaththatsclear.com) or visit the website with the [contact us form](http://www.apaththatsclear.com/contact-us.html).  We love to get inquiries and really want to facilitate and get people involved as much as involved.  We’re eager to talk to folks and get people as involved as we can.

**To wrap up, what advice would you give to someone who is in the early stages of their career passionate about fighting global poverty?**

I guess the general advice would be to do a lot of networking and a lot of cold calling.  If you have an inkling of a direction you want to go in, find the people who are operating in that field and reach out to them.  I’ve been really pleasantly surprised by how well that’s worked out for me and how people have been willing to share their time and thoughts with me (and like-minded people).  If you hear "no" a few times, it’s not a big deal.

**We’ve decided to do more of that in CEA.  We think we’re too reluctant to contact people.  The worst you can get is "no".**

Exactly.  I’ve been kind of shocked at the people who have said yes.

I recently came across Taylor Conroy, who’s using a new fundraising technique to let ordinary people raise $8,500 to build a school with just [an evening’s work](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC02SmuOxYI). The method has been expanded to include [water pumps and libraries](http://www.thechangeheroes.com/sign-up/#.UGSEz03A_Sg).

The fundraising is amazing, but I can’t help slightly regretting the goal towards which Taylor has directed his considerable talents. Building a school is a motivating, tangible project, which seems to *obviously* be a good thing. They can send you pictures of it after it’s built. According to [Change Heros](http://www.thechangeheroes.com/sign-up/#.UGSEz03A_Sg):

*"Each of these projects are incredibly needed and will change the world for the better."*

School building seems like one of the most popular projects in charity. There’s a whole range of organisations that let you do it. Change Heros uses [Free to Children](http://www.freethechildren.com/get-involved/campaigns/brick-by-brick/), but there’s also [Asante](http://www.asanteafrica.org/ourwork/places.php?gclid=CIz65eer2LICFaTKtAodalEAdQ), [Build a School](http://buildaschool.org.uk/), [Build Africa](http://www.build-africa.org/pages/help-us-build-a-school.html?gclid=CNzuluar2LICFQfKtAodRgsAGg), and not to mention all those [gap year](http://www.gapyear.com/volunteering/community-projects) volunteer programs that let you travel to Africa to help out with the construction.

But is this really where we should be directing our efforts? Here's an alternative case.

---

1) **The most obvious benefit of building schools is to increase attendance, but it’s unclear they even do that**

Studies in Africa found that providing better quality, closer schools could increase average attendance by about 2 years, but were plagued by problems in the methodology [^2].

The best study on the topic showed that a major program of school construction in Indonesia led to 0.12-0.19 extra years in school per school per 1000 kids. The study, however, considers several methods. And the method favoured by [Givewell](http://www.givewell.org/international/education/detail#footnote15_mbczlw7), which best allows us to isolate the impact of school construction, found a figure at the bottom of this range, which was too small to be statistically significant[^1].

This makes sense when you consider that the existing schools have already been put in the best locations. Extra schools tend to be in remote areas where it wasn’t worth building a school before.

&nbsp;

2) **Even if you get kids into well-built schools in the developing world, there may be no benefits**

Some studies have shown that an extra year of school attendance boosts income by 10%[^3]. These studies normally suffer with serious problems [demonstrating causation](http://givewell.org/international/education/detail#Beyondtestscores), though there has been some promising progress more recently. Moreover, several large scale studies show no or very small effects on countrywide GDP due to recent improvements in education[^4]. This suggests that the economic benefits of education are mainly at the expense of other people in the country. In other words, it only changes who gets the skilled jobs, not how many skilled jobs there are in the first place.

Perhaps education has value in itself, independent of economic benefits? Well there doesn’t seem to be any correlation between years in education and happiness either, once you've controlled for other factors[^5]. Education seems to primarily have value as a means to an end, unlike health and wealth, which do relate to happiness.

These results sound incredible. How could education not make people more productive and happy? One problem is that education in the develooping world is often [extremely poor](http://blog.givewell.org/2009/09/28/developing-world-scholarships-and-school-building/). Teachers are absent all the time. The materials are poor. The lessons are aimed at the top student, who they hope will go to university. Building schools without guaranteeing quality seems likely to have little impact. Unfortunately we know little about how to guarantee quality teaching.  Good teachers tend to have similar backgrounds to bad teachers. And methods that have worked in one area often fail in another[^10].

Another likely factor is that extra education only has benefits when combined with other changes in the economy. If no jobs are being created that make use of the better educated students, then it makes sense that the economy won’t grow. It could be that most developing world countries are currently not constrained by having enough educated workers, but something else[^11]. During certain special periods in the past, like the Green Revolution, increasing education *has* increased average wages[^11].

This is not to say that we shouldn't try to improve education in the developing world. Rather, we need to do more research into the interventions that actually have benefits, and we shouldn’t expect merely building schools without these other changes to help. Some of the charities listed do seek to provide an [entire package](http://www.freethechildren.com/international-programming/our-model/) of development improvements in a small area, though they can't change government policy or create opportunities for better educated kids in the cities. These holistic approaches make more sense, but suffer from a lack of quality impact data. We can't assess what would have happened without the intervention, or separate causation from correlation. They also involve considerable additional costs.

One bright spot is that there is evidence that getting kids in school, especially women, improves health. In particular, it can cause a significant reduction in infant mortality[^6]. But we don’t have evidence that it improves health more effectively than [providing malaria nets and deworming](http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities).

&nbsp;

3) **If you want to get kids into school, there are much better ways to do it**

It’s less sexy, but one study showed that simply telling parents about the benefits of education can get an extra kid into school for a year only $5[^7]. That figure is likely an underestimate of what it would actually cost to implement such a program, but if it’s roughly right it means that $8,500 would be enough to ensure that 350 children receive full primary school educations. I’m still waiting for details from [Free the Children]((http://www.freethechildren.com/get-involved/campaigns/brick-by-brick/) about how many children would be affected by this much money spent on school building.

Four studies have shown that providing deworming medicine can cause a child to spend an extra year in school for an average of only $7[^8]. Deworming is definitely not sexy, but it’s also an extremely effective health intervention with large room for funding that’s well worth doing anyway. Givewell’s second highest recommended charity [distributes deworming medicine](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative)

It might be that just providing free breakfasts at existing schools could raise attendance about 30%[^9].

The Copenhagen Consensus makes a strong case that encouraging more demand for schooling is currently a much better intervention than increasing supply by building schools[^10]. First, the demand-side interventions just mentioned are cheap, effective and proven. But there are other reason to expect them to work better. One factor is that if demand is strong, then in some cases the local government will step in and supply the school. But more importantly:

* Building a school involves a large up-front cost, with a long payback, and if teacher quality is low or the students don’t come, then years down the line we’ll find that the money has been wasted. Demand-side interventions take effect immediately, so can be adjusted if not working. Some methods, like free breakfasts or scholarships, are only paid out if the student attends.

* The benefits of education are much smaller if the student doesn’t learn to read and write, which normally takes about five years. Drop outs part way through education are common. Demand-side interventions can be targeted at areas where kids are already in school and help them to stay the course. Helping kids to get an extra year or two of education could often make all the difference.


Of course, demand-side interventions are only going to work if there’s enough schools around in the first place. But the positive results of these trials shows that there are currently plenty of areas in which there are. In the future, we might need to switch back to building schools. If we keep monitoring our impact, we’ll know when then needs to be.

Taylor’s new ways to inspire people to give in a fulfilling way have huge potential to make people in the developing world better off. But rather than send the money to programs that might do no good at all, let’s focus on those where we have evidence they work. And let’s do much more research, getting a clear idea of the benefits of education, and how we can best bring them about. The challenge for fundraisers like Taylor is to get people excited about the unsexy and less tangible projects that often make the most difference.

##Introduction

In an earlier post we reviewed the arguments in favor of the idea that we should primarily assess causes in terms of whether they [help build a society that’s likely to survive and flourish in the very long-term](http://80000hours.org/blog/245-how-important-are-future-generations). We think this is a plausible position, but it raises the question: what activities in fact *do* help improve the world over the very long term, and of those, which are best? We’ve been asked this question several times in recent case studies.

First, we propose a very broad categorisation of how our actions today might affect the long-run future.

Second, as a first step to prioritising different methods, we compiled a list of approaches to improve the long-run future that are currently popular among the community of people who explicitly believe the long-run future is highly important.

The list was compiled from our knowledge of the community, which principally includes the people associated with CEA, MIRI, FHI, GCRI and related organisations. Please let us know if you think there are other important types of approach that have been neglected. Further, note that this post is not meant as an endorsement of any particular approach; just an acknowledgement that it has significant support.

Third, we comment on how existing mainstream philanthropy may or may not influence the far future.


##(1) What kinds of changes can last?

If we are concerned with influencing the very far future, we might first wonder: what kind of actions could possibly have an effect extending for millions of years, even in principle?

Many possible changes seem like they will “wash out” over timescales much shorter than millions or billions of years, so that the long-term effect is highly unpredictable. One reason for this is that very fundamental characteristics of society are likely to change significantly over such long timescales. Another is that most social characteristics---especially those which we currently have an opportunity to intervene on---tend to be constantly changing, and so in most cases the long-run behavior is either convergence towards a particular stable outcome or indefinite variation which eventually washes out any individual perturbation.

So to identify changes that might last a very long time, we are interested in situations where there are multiple stable outcomes. To date, the academic community researching these issues, primarily formed of researchers at Oxford's FHI, has identified four broad kinds of changes that may have very long-term effects:

1. **Extinction**. If all life on earth was destroyed, it is possible that it would not be replaced, either from Earth nor from anywhere else. If there is any non-negligible chance that life on Earth will give rise to a healthy civilization extending beyond Earth, avoiding premature extinction could have an effect which lasts for billions of years.

2. **Changing values**. Even if Earth does give rise to a healthy long-lived civilization, we are uncertain about the values of that civilization. Moreover, with sufficiently advanced technology a change in the values of a civilization might be able to persist essentially indefinitely: a civilization with certain values might work hard to ensure that its successors share important core values (and those successors may then “pay it forward”). Note that the “values” of a civilization might take many shapes, ranging from being enshrined in powerful governments to being embodied by genetic characteristics and predispostiions of the population.

3. **Speedup**. Speeding up events in society this year looks like it may have a lasting speedup effect on the entire future---it might make all of the future events happen slightly earlier than they otherwise would have. In some sense this changes the character of the far future, although the current consensus is that this doesn’t do much to change the value of the future. Shifting everything forward in time is essentially morally neutral.

4. **Unanticipated effects**. There may be other long-lasting effects which we have not yet considered. For example, it may be possible for certain kinds of standards or norms to become entrenched and last for a very long time. Although we cannot yet tell a detailed story about how such a change could persist, we might learn more in the future, or we might be able to indirectly predict whether the unanticipated effects of particular choices will tend to be positive or negative.

Although relatively few changes seem likely to have a direct long-term effect, a much broader variety of changes could have important short-term effects, which then catalyze very long-term effects. 

For example, choices about the organization of the US government in the 18th century seem unlikely to have a direct long-term effect. However, they have already had a massive influence over events of the previous centuries and could exert a similar influence over coming centuries. This influence may in turn effect other changes which can have a direct long-term influence; for example, the organization of the US government has an effect on the risk of a war which destroys all life on Earth. This influence will also lead to many other changes which themselves have indirect effects; for example, on economic prosperity or the quality of education. It seems unlikely that a cascade of indirect effects could last indefinitely---every step slightly spreads out the impact and makes it more uncertain---but it could continue for quite some time before resulting in a change that has a direct effect on the far future.

Similarly, we can imagine many “speed bumps” in the contemporary development trajectory which might not have a direct long-term influence, but which might facilitate larger catastrophes down the line. For example: war, long-term technological stagnation, catastrophic climate change, social collapse.
## (2) Ways to improve the far future
Philanthropists concerned about the far future have pursued many varied interventions, and should be expected to pursue many more in the future. However, the following stand out as the most popular strategies today (note that some of these projects, in particular ACE and GiveWell, are not *run* by altruists focused on the far future, although they have the support of many people who take the far future seriously):

**Movement building** (e.g, [LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com), us)
**Managing AI impacts** (e.g. [MIRI](http://lesswrong.com)), including understanding AI impacts, developing safety mechanism, differential technological development
Analyzing far-future effects (e.g. [FHI](http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/))
Capacity building (e.g. [IARPA’s ACE](http://www.iarpa.gov/Programs/ia/ACE/ace.html), [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org/) the [Good Judgement Project](http://www.goodjudgmentproject.com/)), including improving individual and collective decision-making and improving philanthropy

This should certainly not be considered an exhaustive list of possible approaches to improving the far future. But together with the next section, which discusses the flow-through effects of more proximal do-gooding, this inventory does capture most of the ideas that have been advanced by people *so far*.
###Movement building
Many future-looking altruists support movement building and outreach. These organizations encourage their audiences to make more altruistic decisions, and moreover encourage applying careful thought to altruistic decisions. The aim is to build a community of people able to carry out the other most promising approaches to improving the far future, whatever those turn out to be. We see this is as one of the potential benefits of 80,000 Hours.
 
Another example of this approach is the Center for Applied Rationality, which promotes reflectiveness, metacognition, a quantitative mindset, and careful decision-making, and is creating a broad community of “rationalists” which is relatively closely tied to effective altruism. CFAR is the conceptual successor to the internet community LessWrong, which has already created a very large number of individuals interested in influencing the future, and has a strong emphasis on futurism and taking unusual ideas seriously.

These efforts vary significantly in how directly they deal with the far future; CFAR works rather indirectly, by promoting some of the ideas that are important to future-shaping and then introducing the others into the accompanying social environment. [Other efforts](http://effective-altruism.com/preventing-human-extinction) involve more direct appeals. 

Naturally, movement building is complementary with the other strategies on this list. The existence of projects working directly on influencing the far future makes it easier to argue that this is a problem which we can and should do something about. The existence of directly useful projects that can absorb funding and human capital also increases the value of having additional people who care about the far future.

###Managing AI impacts
Understanding and influencing the impacts of human-level AI is another popular cause amongst future-looking altruists. Some thinkers, for example Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nick Bostrom, think that there is a good chance that the emergence of general human-level AI will have an extremely disruptive social impact, and that there is a significant chance that this impact will be negative unless it is managed carefully. If there is any material chance of human-level AI within the next few decades, then this may be an opportunity for future-looking altruists to have a huge impact on the world. Managing a transition to AI may be a case where concern about the far future encourages us to take an issue particularly seriously that the rest of the world is willing to neglect, and thereby allows future-looking altruists to have an outsized impact.

The most promising options in this space seem to be: 

**Understanding AI impacts**. At the moment we have a very weak understanding of what the field of AI will look like when mature, or what its likely social impacts will be. Some of this uncertainty will be very difficult to resolve because so much technical research remains to be done within AI. But exploring the consequences of particular scenarios we can currently envision and evaluating available evidence that bears on which scenarios are likely, may help reduce our uncertainty. This could be particularly valuable for understanding what social characteristics might increase our probability of managing a transition to AI successfully, and helping reduce the probability of surprising developments.

**Developing “safety” mechanisms**. Despite our uncertainty about AI, we can envision a number of concrete scenarios, and within those scenarios we can identify particular technical problems which would be helpful to solve. For example, we can imagine scenarios in which there is a discontinuous change in AI capabilities and work to design environments in which such discontinuous changes pose a minimal risk of disruption. Work on those problems today is very unlikely to be directly relevant to managing a transition to AI; but beginning to think about these problems today may give work on the safety problems more of a head-start.

**Differential technological development**. Despite our uncertainty about AI, we may be able to predictably identify certain research programs as more or less conducive to disruptive transitions. For example, it seems plausible that advancing principled understanding of intelligent behavior more quickly than practical understanding of AI implementation will improve our ability to anticipate the impacts of AI and thereby avoid disruptions. If this judgment is correct, then doing work on understanding intelligence today may improve our ability to cope with AI by slightly but predictably changing what we know at the time when human-level AI arrives.
 
Most researchers in AI are moderately or highly skeptical of the impact of this work, primarily because they think human-level AI is quite distant and it is very likely that we will know much more about AI by the time we have realistic opportunities to influence that transition. This may reflect different views on empirical questions, or may reflect future-looking altruists’ unusual willingness to invest significant effort for modest changes in the probability of AI having a positive impact.

Several of these approaches are currently being pursued at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, although increasingly the focus is on concrete technical problems that fall under category (c), via their anticipated positive effect on the development of transparent and easily understood AIs. Some of this work is also being done at the Future of Humanity Institute. 
###Analyzing far-future effects
Some thinkers (for example Nick Bostrom) and philanthropists believe that the most important near-term activity is clarifying our understanding of the long-term impacts of contemporary choices. Because so little attention has been paid to these effects, it seems quite plausible that our understanding will be significantly revised by further research. Given the possibility of order-of-magnitude gaps between the effectiveness of different interventions improving our understanding may have a huge positive impact.

This kind of research might help future-looking altruists prioritize their activities or discover new strategies. The existence of improved arguments might make the case for improving the far future attractive to a much broader group of people. And understanding which traditional activities are highest-impact might influence the behavior of a much broader group of people who consider effects on the far future to be just one consideration amongst many.

Currently a small amount of this research is being done at the Future of Humanity Institute, and a small amount of research is being done by individuals in the broad communities surrounding the Centre for the Effective Altruism and the Machine Intelligence Research Institute.
###Capacity building
Probably the broadest and one of the most popular interventions is improving social capabilities that appear to be directly related to successfully navigating future problems. Since most altruists who are explicitly concerned with the far future think that the greatest human challenges will be created by humans, capacity building is only useful to the extent that it increases our ability to solve problems faster than our creation of them. 

There are two basic reasons that capacity building might be more useful for resolving problems than making them: it may be that you build abilities that are in and of themselves more useful for resolving problems, or it may be that you focus your efforts to improve abilities within communities that seem to be resolving problems more than creating them. To the extent that most individuals have goals which are essentially aligned with our values, we should expect that improvements in people’s ability to reason and plan should systematically improve the quality of the future, because bad things that happen are disproportionately likely to be the result of errors or failures. 

The most popular approaches to capacity-building amongst future-looking altruists can be divided into three overlapping categories:

**Individual decision-making and forecasting.** There seems to be significant variation in the quality of individual decisions, based on experience, intelligence, thoughtfulness and reflectiveness, conscientiousness, etc. By changing some of these characteristics, we might be able to increase people’s ability to get what they want, hopefully with positive impacts for the future. For example, CFAR aims to encourage reflectiveness and metacognition. There is also some interest amongst far-future concerned altruists in more speculative proposals to improve human cognition via chemical enhancement or genetic engineering.

**Collective decision-making and forecasting.** Most important decisions are made by groups of people, and the quality of those decisions depends not only on the characteristics of individuals but on the mechanisms they use for discussion, aggregation, decision-making, and so on. Innovations in this space might improve the quality of collective decision-making. For example Robin Hanson works on decision markets and pushes for their adoption on the theory that they would significantly improve collective decision-making. Philip Tetlock is currently running [*The Good Judgement Project*](http://www.goodjudgmentproject.com/), which aims to improve forecasting methods.

**Methodology in philanthropy.** Today it seems like altruistically motivated spending could play an important role in making the world, and in particular the far future, much better. But altruistically-motivated spending faces many distinctive and significant challenges. Improving our collective ability to overcome those challenges would increase the impact of philanthropy, improve the efficiency of government and NGO budgets, help individuals make effective choices with their careers, and on balance seems likely to significantly improve the world. For example, GiveWell is pioneering a hard-nosed approach to charity impact evaluation which seems like it may significantly increase the reach and impact of future philanthropy, including big gains for the far future. Similarly, 80,000 Hours aims to significantly improve the process of choosing a career that makes the world a better place.

As we’ll discuss in the next section, these capacity-building interventions are quite similar to those pursued by many philanthropists who aren’t concerned about the far future, though for slightly different reasons. They seem to differ primarily because philanthropists concerned with the future tend to have a very quantitative mindset and contrarian bent, which leads them to focus on different kinds of capacity-building. This raises the concern that future-looking philanthropists may not be able to add as much value in this space as in more distinctively future-focused causes.

##(3) Mainstream altruism and the far future
Unfortunately, very little serious thought has been applied to the question of how to build a civilization that’s robust and prosperous in the very long-term. It is somewhat difficult to distinguish between a number of possible explanations for the current situation: the majority of altruists have relatively little concern for future generations, have not encountered the relevant arguments, correctly or incorrectly reject the relevance of these arguments, or some combination of each.

Even if they never thought about these considerations or don’t care about the future at all, altruistically-motivated activities in the wider world are probably having some predictable effect on the very far future, and may be having a very significant effect. In many cases people are working on high-leverage ways to make the world better in the near-term (either out of altruism or by successfully internalizing the gains from trade); if positive long-term changes systematically involve positive short-term changes, then we might expect the best long-term opportunities to be amongst causes ordinary altruists support. This is far from obvious, but seems plausible a priori.

We can divide the bulk of the plausible positive effects of the broader world into three overlapping categories: the “ripple effects” of general human empowerment, capacity building work which is not directly concerned with the far future but may nevertheless be relevant, or efforts to mitigate near-term risks which may be directly relevant to the far future or may incidentally mitigate catastrophic risks with long-term consequences.

Note that even if ordinary approaches and strategies turned out to be the most important ways to improve the far future, because so many more people have taken an interest in them it is much less clear that future-looking philanthropists can add significant value. It is most plausible that future-looking philanthropists can contribute significantly to these causes if either (1) the same characteristics that cause people to be interested in the far future also cause them to prioritize better in general, or (2) an identifiable and relatively small subset of these causes has a much larger effect than the others, so that future-looking philanthropists can focus on those causes and still have a big impact.

###Mitigating contemporary risks
There are also many intelligent altruists who focus on improving the stability and robustness of the modern world, motivated by general arguments about the significance of foreseeable risks and the moral significance of future generations. The most popular interventions in this class are coping with climate change (mitigation and adaptation), promoting sustainability / social resilience, and promoting nuclear disarmament and global peace. 

Again, the real long-term effects of these interventions are not understood, and often the focus is on catastrophic risks which are not existential risks (in particular, social collapse and massive loss of life). At the moment it seems unlikely that even extremely pessimistic climate change or world war scenarios would end life on Earth, and the actual long-term effects of the probable catastrophe scenarios seem quite uncertain. Combined with the relatively low per annum probability of catastrophe, these interventions approaches seem to have a relatively modest effect on long-term aggregate welfare, although it is nevertheless possible that they amongst the most effective ways to have a long-term effect (it is certainly *a priori* plausible that the most important catastrophic risks are also the most important extinction risks, even if extinction is quite unlikely).

###“Ripple effects” of human empowerment
Many intelligent altruists work on projects that alleviate poverty or resolve challenges in individuals’ lives, resolve structural problems in society, contribute to economic or technological development, or similar. This work might have a large indirect effect on the future.

The main reason for optimism is the observation that broad social interests are basically aligned with the important mechanisms for improving the far future. Extinction has negative effects not only for far future people but for existing people; a distortion in social values that caused it to no longer reflect human values would be bad in the short-term as well as the long run; and similar patterns might be expected to hold for unanticipated effects on long-run welfare. Moreover, as long as few people actively work to degrade the far future, the existence of a modest number of altruists concerned with the far future would already tip the scales in favor of general empowerment. 

As a result, anything which generally improves humans’ abilities to get what they want seems to be positive on balance, and may be significantly so. Improving education, reducing poverty, fixing structural problems, speeding up economic development, and so on, all boost present peoples’ ability to get what they want.

Although these activities may indirectly improve the far future, the nature and magnitude of these effects is highly uncertain and hasn’t been investigated very closely. So it may be possible to prioritize much more effectively if these effects were better understood. Moreover, there is some disagreement amongst future-looking philanthropists as to whether many of these effects are even positive on balance. For example, it might be the case that social change mediated by the gradual turnover of generations is a force for good which plays a smaller role in society if there is more activity. In that case, it may be that boosting economic growth actually has a negative effect on the world.
###Capacity building
The same abilities are needed to cope with a wide range of future challenges, including both challenges that will have a negative impact immediately and those that will have a negative impact on the very far future. Contemporary philanthropists often try to increase society’s ability to cope with such challenges, by improving the quality of education, of governance, of public discourse, of media coverage, and so on. 

The case for a positive impact here is quite similar to the case for general human empowerment, but is somewhat more direct and superficially more plausible. Most of these forms of capacity-building would have a direct impact on society’s ability to cope with an extinction risk, for example. Indeed, the capacity-building pursued by futurist philanthropists and the capacity-building pursued by traditional philanthropists seem to differ primarily by the quantitative mindset and contrarian bent of people who are willing to focus on the very far future.]]></content:encoded><dsq:thread_identifier>Ă</dsq:thread_identifier><wp:post_date_gmt>2013-10-07 17:07:00</wp:post_date_gmt><wp:comment_status>open</wp:comment_status><wp:comment><wp:comment_id>1363</wp:comment_id><wp:comment_author>Luke Muehlhauser</wp:comment_author><wp:comment_author_email>lukeprog@gmail.com</wp:comment_author_email><wp:comment_author_url>http://80000hours.org/members/luke-muehlhauser</wp:comment_author_url><wp:comment_author_IP>255.255.255.255</wp:comment_author_IP><wp:comment_date_gmt>2013-10-07 22:52:47</wp:comment_date_gmt><wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Good post.
